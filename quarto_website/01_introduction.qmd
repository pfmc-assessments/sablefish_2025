---

This website contains information about this year's benchmark assessment of sablefish off the U.S. West Coast. The stock assessment team is Chantel Wetzel (Northwest Fisheries Science Center \[NWFSC\], lead author, chantel.wetzel\@noaa.gov), Aaron Berger (NWFSC), Cheryl Barnes (Oregon State University), Joshua Zahner (University of Alaska Fairbanks), and Nick Tolimieri (NWFSC).

Sablefish of the U.S. West Coast are managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC). Sablefish are considered to be a single stock, with separate Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) set north and south of 36$\degree$ North Latitude. The most recent benchmark assessment for sablefish of the West Coast was conducted in [2019](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2019/10/status-of-the-sablefish-stock-in-u-s-waters-in-2019-october-22-2019.pdf/) with a partial update assessment being conducted in [2023](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2024/02/status-of-sablefish-anoplopoma-fimbria-along-the-u-s-west-coast-in-2023.pdf/).
