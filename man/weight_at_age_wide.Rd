\title{Turn a long data frame of weight-at-age data into a wide data frame by age}
\usage{
weight_at_age_wide(dat, value = c("weight", "length", "count"), max_age = 70)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame created from \code{\link[=weight_at_age_read]{weight_at_age_read()}} or one that has the
following column names:
\itemize{
\item source,
\item weight_kg,
\item sex,
\item age_years,
\item length_cm, and
\item year.
}}

\item{value}{A character value specifying which type of data you are
interested in. The options include \code{"weight"}, \code{"length"}, and \code{"count"},
where the latter will supply the sample size.}

\item{max_age}{The age of the plus-group bin. The default is 40 years old.
This age and all older ages will be combined into a single age bin..}
}
\value{
A data frame with the first six columns pertaining to metadata,
i.e., #Yr, seas, sex, growth pattern (GP), bseas, and fleet, and additional
columns pertaining to each age starting with age zero up to the maximum age
supplied with the argument \code{max_age}. Ages for which there were no
samples are filled with \code{NA}. If \code{value = "count"}, then
the data frame will return sample sizes for each age rather than mean
weight- or length-at-age.
}
\description{
Take the long-format, which is indicative of raw data, weight-at-age data
and make a wide data frame based on ages such that the data frame can be
written for Stock Synthesis.
