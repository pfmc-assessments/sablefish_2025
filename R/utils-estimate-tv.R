#' Estimate time-varying weight at age
#'
#' @details Predict weight-at-age for fishery and survey data without spatial
#' information, where the model includes age, year, cohort, and sex. There is a
#' smoother on age, year is modeled as a random effect, cohort is also a random
#' effect, and sex is a linear predictor to estimate weight, i.e.,
#' (weight ~ 1 + s(age) + (1|fcohort) + (1|fyear) + sex).
#' @param max_age An integer specifying the maximum age of the modeled data
#'   in the Stock Synthesis model. All age data beyond this will be assigned
#'   to the maximum age. This is typically the age beyond which data are sparse
#'   and weight and length are essentially the same across ages. The default is
#'   fifteen for Pacific Hake.
#' @param first_year A four-digit integer specifying the first year of data in
#'   the assessment model. Sometimes weight-at-age data might begin before this
#'   year but the data are so sparse for other data that the model should not
#'   include this year as a separate year. For example, weight-at-age data for
#'   Pacific Hake start in the early 70s, which means that the cohorts are
#'   predicted for years prior to this, i.e., year - age, so we want to remove
#'   these early years with little data. The default for Pacific Hake is 1975.
#' @return
#' A data frame in long format with time-varying weight-at-age data.
