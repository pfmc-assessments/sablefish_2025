## Outline

* Background
* Model Summary
* Biology
* Fishery-Dependent Data
* Fishery-Independent Data

## Background

- Range from Baja California northward to the north-central Bering Sea and in the northwestern Pacific Ocean from Kamchatka southward to the northeastern coast of Japan
- Relatively long-lived, with many observations > 60 years of age
- Genetically similar across their range
- Caught primarily in commercial fisheries

## Model Summary

* Estimated stock size and status
* Recruitment
* Changes for 2025


## Estimated Stock Size and Status

* Age 3+ Summary Biomass in 2025: 246,677 mt
* Stock Status in 2025: 33.9%

## Recruitment

* Years with highest positive recruitment deviation: 2023, 2020, and 2016
* Years with lowest negative recruitment deviation: 2005, 2007, and 2009

## Changes for 2025

Data:

- Improved estimates of removals (landings and discards) and inclusion of additional historical age data. 
- New maturity-at-age and empirical weight-at-age.
- Split the Triennial Survey into early and late and remove data from select years.

Model:

- Implementation of discard fleets based upon 3 gear groups: trawl, hook-and-line, and pot.
- Improved parameterization for estimating annual recruitment deviations.

## Biology 

- Distribution off the U.S. West Coast
- Maturity-at-age
- Growth and weight-at-age
- Natural mortality

## Distribution

## Natural Mortality (*M*)

- Female and male *M* estimated as a single parameter based upon similar sex-specific estimates during model development
- *M* is constant across ages and years
- Lognormal prior included (Hamel and Cope 2022) based on a maximum age of 75 based upon the ~99.9 quantile from data collected from the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey 
- A slightly higher frequency of old males compared to old females which could be due to differences in *M* or higher fishing pressure on females due to growth differences

## Growth 

- Latitudinal changes in growth along the West Coast with Kapur et al. 2020 identifying change point in growth ~ 36$^\circ$ N. lat.
- Data suggest potential periods of varying growth rates which discussed in detail in the 2019 review

## Weight-at-Age

## Weight-at-Age - Females

## Weight-at-Age - Males

![](plots/bio5_weightatsize2.png){.absolute top=100 left=50 width="980" height="480"}

## Maturity-at-Age

- Sablefish mature at younger ages more frequently in the north compared to the south
- Blue vertical dashed line at age 7
