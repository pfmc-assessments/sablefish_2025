## Recruitment

* Years with highest positive recruitment deviation: 2023, 2020, and 2016
* Years with lowest negative recruitment deviation: 2005, 2007, and 2009
* Strong recruitment at the end of the time series driving the stock up

![](plots/recdevs2_withbars.png){.absolute top=250 right=30 width="480" height="350"}

::: {.notes}
Strong recruitment in recent years generally matches trens in BC and Alaska
:::

## Model Sensitivities

- The data from the WCGBTS is informing the magnitude of the population increase in recent years
- Population scale in the model is sensitive to the assumptions about natural mortality (*M*)

![](plots/sens_3_compare18_smrybio.png){.absolute top=280 right=20 width="480" height="350"}

::: {.notes}
Remove WCGBTS: Estimates of rec. devs. are less positive or more negative when these data are removed, stock status of 28%, M estimate increases to 0.094
Growth and M: Alaska M 0.114, Migration M 0.132, 2019 female M 0.076 and male M 0.068, highest stock status of 40% is estimated with the 2019 M values and lowest (26%) with M for migration
:::

## Data Changes for 2025

- Add all recent fishery and survey data: removals, indices of abundance, and age compositions 
- Inclusion of additional historical age data (1983-2010) primarily collected in Oregon from trawl gear
- Improved estimates of removals: landing and discard mortality
- New maturity-at-age and empirical weight-at-age
- New environmental recruitment index from 2020--2024
- Split the Triennial Survey into early and late and remove data from select years
- Remove the AFSC Slope Survey due to non-representative sampling of lengths for age data


## Biology 

- Distribution off the U.S. West Coast
- Maturity-at-age
- Growth and weight-at-age
- Natural mortality

## Distribution: Presence/Absense

- Sablefish are observed by the WCGBTS coastwide off the U.S. West Coast and across a wide range of depths

![](plots/distribution_latitude.png){.absolute top=200 left=0 width="480" height="350"}

![](plots/distribution_depth.png){.absolute top=200 right=50 width="480" height="350"}

::: {.notes}
Make sure to note the number of untrawlable areas south of 34.5 N. latitude due to RCA, underwater cables, rocky bottom, etc.
:::

## Distribution: Age and Length

![](plots/wcgbts_length_age_compositions.png){.absolute top=100 right=225 width="800" height="550"}

## Natural Mortality (*M*)

- Female and male *M* estimated as a single parameter based upon similar sex-specific estimates during model development
- *M* is constant across ages and years
- Lognormal prior included (Hamel and Cope 2022) based on a maximum age of 75 based upon the ~99.9 quantile from data collected from the WCGBTS
  - The oldest ages (subject to ageing error) off the West Coast are 102 (female) and 98 (male) years of age
- A slightly higher frequency of old males compared to old females in the data which could be due to differences in *M* or higher fishing pressure on females due to growth differences

::: {.notes}
There are 13 observations in all available data of age >= 75 years of age (8 from the fishery and 5 from the survey) ranging from 75 to 102 years of age. Of those 13 fish 10 are males and 3 are female.
The 2019 assessment estimated 0.076 for females and 0.067 for males (translates to a maximum age range 71-80)
The 2019 STAR panel reported variability in estimates with the directionality sometimes changing between sexes
The 2011 assessment estimated 0.08 for females and 0.081 for males
:::

## Growth 

- Latitudinal changes in growth along the West Coast with Kapur et al. 2020 identifying change point in growth ~ 36$^\circ$ N. lat.
- Data suggest potential periods of varying growth rates which was discussed in detail in the 2019 STAR panel

![](plots/growth.png){.absolute bottom=30 right=250 width="680" height="380"}

::: {.notes}
Coastwide: Lmax females 63 cm, males 56 cm
South: Lmax females 60 cm, males 55 cm
North: Lmax females 64 cm, males 57 cm
:::

## Modeling Weight-at-Age

- Weight data was not consistently available in fisheries data coastwide
- Annual age and weight data available from WCGBTS from 2003--2024, excluding 2020
- A GLMM with a log-normal distribution used to model weight-at-age data, based upon the methodology used for Pacific hake
- Weight was assumed to be related to a smoothed effect of age, fixed effect of sex and area, and random effects for cohort and year
- Weight-at-age plus group set at age 30 based upon the estimated growth curve from previous assessments
- Model estimates were weighted by collection area to predict sex-specific weight-at-age for 0 to 30 year old fish

## Modeling Weight-at-Age

- The weighted predictions of mean weight-at-age by sex and year used in the model:

  - 1890--2002: average mean weight-at-age from 2003--2019 and 2021--2024,
  - 2003--2019 and 2021--2024: annual predicted mean weight-at-age,
  - 2020: average mean weight-at-age from 2019 and 2021, and 
  - 2025--2036: average mean weight-at-age from 2020--2024.

## Weight-at-Age: Females

![](plots/bio5_weightatsize.png){.absolute top=100 left=50 width="980" height="480"}

## Weight-at-Age: Males

![](plots/bio5_weightatsize2.png){.absolute top=100 left=50 width="980" height="480"}

## Maturity-at-Age

- Sablefish mature at younger ages more frequently in the north compared to the south
- Blue vertical dashed line at age 6

![](plots/maturity_samples.png){.absolute top=250 right=200 width="780" height="380"}

::: {.notes}
Coastwide: Linf females 63 cm, males 56 cm
North: Linf females 64 cm, males 57 cm
South: Linf females 60 cm, males 55 cm
:::

## Maturity-at-Age: Spatial

- The coastwide biomass weighted maturity-at-age curve (Spatial) was used in the assessment

![](plots/maturity_at_age.png){.absolute bottom=30 right=175 width="850" height="450"}

## Data

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Six fishery fleets
  - Removals
  - Age compositions
- Four survey fleets
  - Abundance indices
  - Age compositions
- One recruitment index (ENV)

![](plots/data_plot.png){.absolute bottom=20 right=0 width="580" height="860"}


## Removals

- Trawl: domestic landings, foreign catch, and at-sea incidental catch
- Hook-and-line: domestic landings, foreign catch,  and recreational catch
- Pot: domestic landings and foreign catch
- Discard fleets: estimated discard mortality by gear type based on the domestic landings (1890--2024) and the discard rates from Pikitch (trawl) and West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP)
  - Previous assessments accounted for discarding by modeling retention.
  - The STAT considers the use of discard fleets as more transparent, supports unique data weighting, and improves model stability.

## Removals

![](plots/removals.png){.absolute top=100 right=175 width="880" height="480"}


::: {.notes}
Peaks in removals in 1976 and 1979 > 25,000 mt driven by foreign catches
Since 2011, the total percentage of sablefish being landing by gear are 43% by HKL, 30% by trawl, and 26% by pot.
Since 2011, the total percentage of sablefish being landing with state ports are 32% in California, 45% in Oregon, and 23% in Washington
Since 2015, annual removals have averaged ~ 5,600 mt
:::

## Discard Mortality Estimates

Available data:

- Discard rates for trawl gear from the Pikitch study from 1985--1987,
- Discard rates by gear from 2002--2010 from WCGOP, and 
- Separate discard rates are available from 2011--2023 from WCGOP for IFQ and non-IFQ vessels where IFQ discard rates are a census and non-IFQ discard rates are a sub-sample of all trips

Improved methodology:

- Calculated weighted discard rate by gear for 2011--2023 based upon the proportion of catch between IFQ and non-IFQ vessels using estimates from the Groundfish Expanded Multiyear Mortality report

## Discard Mortality Estimates

- 1890--1941 and 1946--2001: 
    - Trawl: average of Pikitch discard rates (36%)
    - Hook-and-Line & Pot: average of WCGOP discard rates 2002--2010
- 1942--1946: No discarding
- 2002--2023: Annual WCGOP Discard Rates (weighted rates for 2011+)
- 2024: 2023 WCGOP Discard Rates

:::

## Recruitment Index

- Developed models based on conceptual life history:
  - Cross-shelf transport during pelagic and benthic juvenile stages
  - Temperature during spawning
  - Global Ocean Reanalysis and Simulations (GLORYS) model output
- Models were trained based on estimates of recruitment deviations from the 2023 assessment for 1993--2019
- Recruitment deviations in log-space were predicted for 2020--2024
- R$^2$ ~ 0.47

## Recruitment Index

- Large uncertainty intervals for each year
- Given that age-0 fish are observed by the WCGBTS and age 1 by the trawl fishery, the recruitment index is expected to have limited influence, except for potentially 2023 and 2024
