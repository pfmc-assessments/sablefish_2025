## Stock Size and Status

* Age 3+ summary biomass in 2025: 246,677 mt
* Stock status in 2025: 33.9%
* Stock status is projected to be above 40% in 2027

## Recruitment

* Years with highest positive recruitment deviation: 2023, 2020, and 2016
* Years with lowest negative recruitment deviation: 2005, 2007, and 2009
* Strong recruitment at the end of the time series driving the stock up

## Major Changes 

- Include retained and discard fleets to account for total mortality and improve model stability (i.e., do not estimate retention within the model)
- Inclusion of additional historical age data (1983-2010) primarily collected in Oregon from trawl gear
- Improved estimates of removals: landing and discard mortality
- New maturity-at-age and empirical weight-at-age
- New environmental recruitment index from 2020--2024
- Split the Triennial Survey into early and late and remove data from select years
- Remove the AFSC Slope Survey due to non-representative sampling of lengths for age data
