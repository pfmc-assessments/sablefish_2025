"• Recruitment: Data from the WCGBTS, the sea-level index, and the environmental index of recruitment based on GLORYS model output suggest generally good recruitment (and/or juvenile abundance) conditions over that last 4-5 years, with the exception of 2022. However, there is also some evidence for density dependence leading to reduced juvenile growth following years with strong age-0 abundance.","• Catch reconstruction (landings and discards) is reliable for sablefish, with estimates going back to the early 1900s for trawl fisheries and the incorporation of foreign landings beginning in the 1960s.","• Captures changes in productivity through time-varying growth, recruitment deviations, and natural mortality well. However, available data not informative on absolute stock size or productivity at small stock sizes (steepness)."
• Habitat: The center of gravity of sablefish biomass has shifted approximately 2N likely in response to higher recruitment north of 40N in recent years. ,"• A high degree of confidence in the design, and subsequent population inference, for the primary fishery-independent survey (WCGBTS). The survey covers the most recent 20+ years, so is particuarlly applicable to current management. However, sablefish are found deeper than the limit of survey sampling.","• Made simplifying assumption of constant natural mortality, implying no variation by sex, life-stage (or age), time, or space."
• Prey:  Most available evidence suggests adequate forage for sablefish in 2024 and recent years.  ,"• A recruitment index based on hypothesized environmental-drivers was incorporated into the assessment, informing the most recent 5 years of recruitment strength.",• Steepness fixed at reasonable value (0.75) given life history and management (reference point) objectives. Recruitment deviaitons only estimated for the second half of the time series.
"• Predators: Predation by five main predator groups (California sea lions, sperm whales, porpoises, skates, and fur seal) is unlikely to have changed much in recent years, but there have  been long-term increases in some groups like sea lions.",• Age data is well sampled across the species range for the last 40 years with near continuous sampling from fishery and fishery-independent sources. ,"• Loses or gains in biomass are not captured due to transboundary movements (e.g., Canada). "
"• Competitors: Changes in competition are highly uncertain;  we can’t quantitatively determine that euphausiid abundance is limiting for sablefish, but there is some potential for competition by hake and sablefish for prey (euphausiids).","• Age data available beginning at age-0, so some information on recruitment present up through the final data year. ",• No long term trends in recruitment. Estimates of large cohorts are robust across sensitivity runs with little to no retrospective patterns. Recent recruitment informed by environmental index.
,• Age data are generally fit well with realistic selectivity assumptions. The WCGBT survey fits and tracks the primary dynamics well.,• Sensitivity runs reasonable and generally produce symmetric changes relative to base model results.
,"• Time-varying growth incorporated using empirical weight-at-age methods, where annual growth was integrated across latitude according to survey biomass estimates. New estimates of functional maturity were also integrated across latitude to capture spatial differences.","• Model stability considerably improved, with stable jitters and consistent identifiable parameters at reasonable values across many data and structural model changes."
