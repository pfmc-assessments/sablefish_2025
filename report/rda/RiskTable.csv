Ecosystem and environmental conditions,Assessment data inputs,Assessment model fits and structural uncertainty
• Recruitment: Recent strong recruitment is considered under the assessment data inputs. [Not Scored],"• Catch reconstructions (landings and
discards) date back to the early 1900s for hook-and-line and trawl fisheries. Foreign landings records began in the 1960s. [Neutral]",• Length data were available but no used in the model [Neutral]
,,
• Habitat: The center of gravity for sablefish biomass has shifted approximately 2° northward in recent years. [Unknown] ,• There is high confidence in the primary fishery-independent survey (WCGBTS). Sablefish also occur deeper than the survey samples. [Favorable],• Age data generally fit well with realistic selectivity assumptions. Estimates of recent large cohorts were robust across sensitivity runs. The model estimates recent recruitments based on age data and the recruitment index. [Favorable] 
,,
• Prey: Increased euphausiid and juvenile hake biomass suggest adequate prey availability for sablefish in recent years. [Favorable],• An informative but highly uncertain environmentally driven recruitment index was incorporated into the assessment for the most recent 5 years. [Neutral],• Natural mortality was estimated but assumed to be constant for all life stages and across time and space. Natural mortality was set to be equal by sex based upon similar model estimates. [Neutral]
,,
"• Predators: Sablefish consumption (by California sea lions, sperm whales, porpoises, skates, and fur seals) is unlikely to have changed in recent years, but there have been long-term increases in the abundance of some groups like sea lions. [Neutral]",• Age data have been relatively well sampled. The WCGBTS provides coastwide age data and ages are available from the fishery for the last 40 years but lack coastwide sampling in recent years. Data to inform recent recruitment is well represented. There are known challenges and uncertainty in ageing. [Favorable],• Steepness was fixed (h = 0.75) given life history and management (reference point) objectives. Available data are not informative of absolute stock size or productivity at small stock sizes. [Neutral] 
,,
"• Competition: There is potential for competition between sablefish and Pacific hake (e.g., for euphausiids). Changes in competitive interactions are highly uncertain given limited information about prey availability and spatiotemporal overlap with potential competitors. Recent large recruitments increase the likelihood of intraspecific, density-dependent, competition. [Unfavorable]",• Time-varying growth relies on empirical weight-at-age and is integrated across latitudes according to survey biomass. [Favorable],"• There is variation in maturity, growth, and potentially other biological processes across the latitudinal range that is partially captured in the model. [Neutral]"
,,
,• Spatially explicit estimates of functional maturity account for latitudinal differences in productivity. [Favorable],"• There is uncertainty with respect to biological stock boundaries, including movement across the Northeast Pacific. [Unfavorable] "
,,
,,• Extensive sensitivity runs produced reasonable results and changes were generally similar relative to base model results. There were little to no retrospective patterns or other diagnostic issues. The model produces stable jitters and parameter estimates that did not considerably vary by data source or as a result of structural changes. [Favorable]
