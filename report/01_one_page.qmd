A coastwide assessment for sablefish off the U.S. West Coast was conducted in 2025 that estimated stock size, stock status, and new harvest limits using all available data through 2024. The 2025 assessment estimates the sablefish stock status to be lower than what was projected by the 2023 assessment, with the population below the management limit of 40 percent and in the precautionary zone until 2027 where the stock status is projected to be greater than 40 percent.

The assessment estimates the population size of mature female fish (spawning output) to be `r sb_final` metric tons and a relative spawning output to unfished of `r depl_final*100` percent in `r end_year`. The projected Add statement about the stock status, projected 2027-28 ofl and abc
