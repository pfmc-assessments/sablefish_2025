## Select Management History {#ref-man-history}

The \gls{gmt} provided a list of select management actions for sablefish since 2010:

- 2010: Limited Entry North sablefish and south daily trip limits removed (max Limited Entry North mortality in 2010 and 2011 right after the removal).
  - Limited Entry North trip limits were lowered in subsequent years because of lower overall harvest limits but removing the daily limit appeared to increase mortality at least right after the change.
  - Limited Entry South trip limits were not lowered to the same degree and mortality remained high for several years after the daily limit was removed, but has since been declining largely due to loss of infrastructure in the south.
  - Discard rate did not appear to change notably for sablefish north or south after the daily limit was removed.
- 2015: Sablefish trip limits closed in Period 6 because sector exceeded catch share.
- 2020: Trawl \gls{rca} off Oregon and California removed.
- 2021: Open Access south sablefish daily trip limit removed.
- 2020 & 2021: Emergency rules to extend season to Nov. 15 and Dec. 31, respectively.
- 2023: Open Access north sablefish daily trip limit removed.
- 2023+: Primary sablefish season permanently extended to Dec. 31.

In 2020, there was a severe impact to the fixed gear sector targeting sablefish with low participation and subsequent years; sablefish prices have been very low since ~2019 and exacerbated by COVID-19.


## Recruitment Index {#rec-appendix}

The sablefish stock-recruitment curve relationship is weak suggesting that environmental drivers are important for determining annual reproductive success and recruitment [@tolimieri2018oceanographic]. Environmental drivers of recruitment for sablefish have received substantial attention with a focus on sea surface height (SSH) [@schirripa2006; @schirripa2009icesjms; @tolimieri2023sea], although some studies have focused more closely on hypothesis-driven selection of oceanic drivers [@tolimieri2018oceanographic]. Modeling work using output from a Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) suggests that strong recruitment is associated with (i) colder conditions during the spawner preconditioning period, (ii) warmer water temperatures during the egg stage, (iii) stronger cross-shelf transport to near-shore nursery habitats during the egg stage, (iv) stronger long-shore transport to the north during the yolk-sac stage, and (v) cold surface water temperatures during the larval stage [@tolimieri2018oceanographic]. However, discontinuities in ROMS output following model upgrades 2010/2011 has motivated looking at alternate oceanographic models.

Here, we evaluate using output from the GLORYS oceanographic model (described further below) for predicting variation in natural log of recruitment deviations from the sablefish stock assessment.

### Conceptual life-history model {#sec-lh}

The conceptual life-history model was developed by @tolimieri2018oceanographic. The the conceptual model is summarized here (@tbl-LH). All predictors were derived from the GLORYS data (see below).

### Oceanographic time series {#sec-oceants}

We used oceanographic model products produced by Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) (<https://marine.copernicus.eu/>) and Mercator Ocean International (MOI) (<https://www.mercator-ocean.eu/>) to test if this modelling framework could be used to produce an environmental index of sablefish recruitment.

We combined two CMEMS products: the Global Ocean Reanalysis and Simulation (GLORYS12V1: GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_PHY_001_030, <https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-000211>) [@Fernandex2018glorys; @Drevillon2022glorys] and the Copernicus Marine global analysis and forecast (CMGAF, GLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_001_024; <https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00016>) [@LeGalloudec2022forecast]. The data are served by the Copernicus Marine Service (<https://marine.copernicus.eu/>). When downloaded, the data covered: GLORYS: 1993-01-01 to 2021-06-31 and CMGAF: 2021-07-01 to 2025-02-01. Note both the reanalysis and the analysis and forecast walk forward in time. For the CMGAF, time series are updated at regular intervals beginning with a daily forecast and hindcast simulation, and a weekly 'hindcast-best analysis' with data assimilation through -15 days [@LeGalloudec2022forecast]. We use "GLORYS" below to refer to the combined data set.

Overall the GLORYS analysis followed @tolimieri2018oceanographic and @haltuch2020oceanographic. More specifically, data for water column temperature, bottom temperature, and mixed-layer depth were downloaded as daily values. For transport variables, monthly means were used to reduce processing time. We included oceanographic variables for 40-48 Â°N and processed as follows for each life-history-stage:

1.  Subsetted data by bottom depth, mixed-layer depth, and distance from shore as relevant (@tbl-LH)

2.  Calculated the daily average across the depth and latitude frames

3.  Subsetted #2 by the relevant monthly/seasonal time periods

4.  Calculated the annual average for 1993-2024 for each potential predictor

Overall, the combined GLORYS time series did not show obvious break points from 2020 to 2021 ([Fig. @fig-glorys-ts]).

#### Correlations among variables {#sec-corr}

GLORYS predictors were pre-screened for correlations among variables and non-linear relationships with sablefish recruitment deviations. Correlated predictors (r $\ge$ 0.75, [Fig. @fig-glorys-corr]) were excluded from the same model.

#### Non-linear relationships {#sec-nonlin}

Non-linearity for individual terms was evaluated by comparing the linear model to a model including both the linear and quadratic forms of the predictor. If the AICc of the quadratic form was lower, we included the quadratic form as a potential predictor as well, but required that the linear term appear in models that included the quadratic from.

### Index development {#sec-indexdevel}

#### Methods

We used linear models to examine relationships between ln(recruitment deviations) from the 2023 sablefish stock assessment and predictors from the GLOYRS model output. We used 1993-2019 as training data, leaving 2020-2024 as out-of-sample for use in the sensitivity analyses. We fit all combinations of the GLORYS predictors, excluding correlated variables from the same model, and limiting the the total number of predictors in any model to three (just over 8 data points per predictor). Model selection was carried out using the 'dredge' function in the MuMIn package in R [@R-base; @MuMIn-cite]. Candidate models were evaluated based on their $\Delta$AICc and number of predictors.

#### Results

Five models had $\Delta$AICc values $\le$ 2.0 (@tbl-aic). All models included cross-shelf transport during pelagic juvenile (CSTpjuv), and benthic juvenile (CSTbjuv) stages. Model 3 was chosen as the best-fit because it had the fewest predictors (2), and these two predictors were in all top-five models providing consistency. The best-fit model explained `r round(r2, 2)*100`% of the variation in recruitment deviations from 1993-2022 ( r^2^ = `r round(r2, 2)` , @tbl-aic, [Fig. @fig-glorys-fit]). The model tracked the data well with most recruitment deviations falling with $\pm$ 1.0 s.e. of the recruitment index ([Fig. @fig-glorys-fit]).

The remaining four models included either Tspawn, DDpre, CSTegg, or CSTyolk as predictors. Thse results suggest that different additional terms migh help explain variance in different years, but that CSTpjuv and CSTbjuv provide a consistent basis for prediction. Including an additional factor like Tpre would increase the explained variance by \~ 10% points (r^2^ = 0.47)

For all models recruitment was negatively correlated with CSTpjuv suggesting that processes like upwelling may be important for producing feeding conditions conducive to survival. CSTbjuv was positively correlated with recruitment, which may indicate that onshore transport during the shift to benthic habitat leads to better recruitment. Both the ROMS analysis and the results here suggest that colder water during the female preconditioning stage (negative correlation with DDpre, here model 2) results in higher recruitment.

#### Model testing {#sec-modeltest}

Model diagnostics were examined and testing was carried out to determine how stable the best-fit model was to both individual years and the precision of the estimates of recruitment deviations. Testing followed @tolimieri2018oceanographic and @haltuch2020oceanographic, but only a subset of test results is shown here:

1\. Jackknife analysis on the best-fit model was used to determine the impact of individual years on the model fit.

2\. Refit the best-fit model using data for 1993-2014and then predict 2015-2019.

3\. Refit the best-fit model for 1993-2014 and predict 20158. Repeat stepping forward one year at a time.

4\. Individual years were jackknifed and then the entire model selection process was rerun to determine the impact of individual years on the selection of the predictors in the best-fit model.

Residual plots showed some deviation from the 1:1 line for the best-fit model ([Fig. @fig-resids]).

![Diagnostics plots from the best-fit model.](figures/F_S1.diagnostic.plots.png){#fig-resids}

Jackknife testing (excluding an individual year and refitting the best-fit model) showed stable results with little change in the r^2^ value ([Figs. @fig-glorys-fit] & [-@fig-jack]). Fitting the best-fit model to 1993-2014 and predicting 2015-2019 produced similar results to the best-fit model [Figs. @fig-glorys-fit], as did predicting ahead one year at a time from 2015 on.

![Results of jackknife analysis indicating changes in the r^2^ when individual years were excluded from the best-fit model.](figures/Figure_5.png){#fig-jack fig-align="center"}

Jackknifing individual years and re-running the entire model selection produced stable model selection. CSTbjuv occurred in 28 of the 30 models (where each model leave out one year); CSTpjuv was in 29 models; and Tspawn was in 27 models. DDegg, CSTegg, and CSTlarv each occurred in one model year.

```{r tbl-jack-refit}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
# just to look at the results
df_jack = data.frame(read.csv(here::here("report", "rda","R_jackknife-dredge-refit.csv")))
df_jack[is.na(df_jack)] <- 0 
cs = colSums(df_jack) 
df_jack = df_jack[,cs!=0]
df_jack[df_jack == 0] <- NA
df_jack[!is.na(df_jack)] <- 1
cs = colSums(df_jack, na.rm = T)

#### Forward prediction {#sec-forwardpred}

GLORYS data were available through 2024, so we used the results of the index fitting above to predict ln recruitment deviations from 2020 - 2024 ([Fig. @fig-predicted-recdevs]. The model predicted average recruitment in 2020 and above average recruitment in 2021, 2023, and 2024. The model picked up low recruitment in 2022, consistent with the recruitment deviations from the 2023 assessment but under predicted high recruitment in 2020, and 2021; thus the predictions were conservative.
