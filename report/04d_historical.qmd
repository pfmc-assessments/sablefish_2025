## Historical Analysis {#historical}

The estimated spawning output across stock assessments since 2005 is shown in @fig-historical-ssb. The estimate of unfished stock size from the base model is higher than other previous assessments, except for the 2005 assessment. The base model estimated a decline in stock size during the early 1970s through the mid 2000s, similar to all other previous assessments. However, the extent of that decline is greater in the base model compared to previous assessments. At the end of the time series, the base model estimates an increase in spawning output similar to the 2021 and 2023 assessments.
