## Stock Description {-}

This assessment reports the status of the `r spp` (*Anoplopoma fimbria*, or `black cod') resource off the coast of the United States (U.S.) from southern California to the U.S.-Canadian border using data through `r data_end_year`. The resource is modeled as a single stock, however `r spp` do disperse to and from offshore sea mounts and along the coastal waters of the continental U.S., Mexico, Canada, and Alaska and across the Aleutian Islands to the western Pacific. Net changes in population size or structure due to movement across the assessment boundary are considered negligible, though alternative assumptions are explored using sensitivity model evaluations.

## Catches {-}

Removals for `r spp` contains various historical domestic landings reconstructions, historical foreign fishery catch, commercial domestic landings, Pacific hake at-sea fishery catch estimates, and recreational landings data. Estimated discards are included for the domestic historical and current commercial landings using available information on discard rates with gear-specific discard mortality rates. The model includes six catch- or discard-based fishery fleets: trawl, hook-and-line, pot, trawl discards, hook-and-line discards, and pot discards. Total removals used in this assessment are shown by fleet in @tbl-es-catches and @fig-es-landings. 

The earliest landings of sablefish off the U.S. West Coast used within in this assessment begin in 1890 with hook-and-line gear. The removals began to slowly increase starting in the 1910s and continued at a roughly constant level until the 1960s, where removals sharply increased due to the expansion of trawling and the use of pot gear (@fig-es-landings). After peaking in the late 1970s, catches slowly decreased until the 2000s when catches generally stabilized roughly between 4,000 and 7,000 metric tons (mt) until present (see @tbl-es-catches for the most recent ten years). The pattern of discarded `r spp` across the time series was similar to catches, though on average discard fleets caught 2 percent of the catch fleets. Over the last 10 years, average annual catch was highest for the hook-and-line fleet (2,204 mt), followed by the trawl (1,706 mt) and pot (1,482 mt) fleets. Over the same period, average annual discards were similar for trawl and hook-and-line gear (80 and 86 mt, respectively) and was lowest for pot gear (51 mt).

## Data and Assessments {-}

The last benchmark stock assessment for sablefish took place in 2019 and was followed by
update assessments in 2021 [@kapur_status_2021] and 2023 [@johnson_status_2023].
Changes and additions between the 2023 update assessment and this assessment are listed
in Section \ref{changes}. This assessment used the most recent version of the Stock Synthesis modeling
platform (3.30.24). Primary data sources include landings and age-composition
data from the retained catch. Discarded `r spp` and associated age-composition data (converted from
length-compositions using a length-age key) are also used in this assessment. Weight-at-age data are used
to empirically track changes in mean growth over time.

The relative index of abundance estimated from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBTS), which includes depths from 55--1,280 m, represents the primary source of information on the stock’s trend and was updated to include the most recent data, covering the period 2003--2024. This assessment also uses a relative index of abundance from the Alaska Fisheries Science Center/NWFSC Triennial Shelf Survey, split into early (1980--1992) and late (1995--2004) periods, and the NWFSC Slope Survey conducted from 1998--2002. Additionally, an environmentally-driven recruitment index was incorporated into the stock assessment to inform the most recent five years of recruitment.

The assessment is based upon a two-sex, age-structured model starting in 1890 and tracking annual changes in
population dynamics up to an accumulated population age group of 70 years.
Natural mortality (*M*) was estimated and assumed to be time invariant and equal
between males and females. An empirical weight-at-age approach was implemented
with sex-specific time-varying growth between 2003--2024 that was spatially integrated on an annual
basis to represent coastwide trends in growth. Weight-at-age prior to 2003 was considered constant. Age
data were grouped by individual age classes between 0--50, with 50 being used as a data plus group.
Age-based selectivity was estimated as dome-shaped for each fleet and survey, and selectivity time blocks were used
to allow for shifts in selectivity for each fishery fleet. Additionally, selectivity was mirrored (e.g., assumed to be the same) between the hook-and-line and pot fleets and sex-specific. Recruitment deviations were estimated from 1975 onwards with no restraint to sum to zero over the main estimation time period (1975--2023).
Steepness (`r h`), the standard deviation of recruitment variability (`r sigma_r`), the functional maturity schedule, and the fecundity
relationship were fixed inputs in the model. Fecundity was time-varying as the product of time-varying weight-at-age data
and a spatially-integrated maturity schedule. The estimates of bias and uncertainty by age in age reading (e.g., ageing error) were updated for this assessment, and
summary biomass was calculated for ages 3 plus. 

The assessment was fit to data and prior information on natural mortality by minimizing the joint negative log-likelihood.
The prior for *M* assumed a log-normal distribution with a median of 0.072 yr$^{-1}$ and a standard error of 0.31. Age composition data
was weighted by downsizing the input samples sizes for each data source following the Francis method. Twelve year projections were conducted that
applied estimated *M*, the final year (i.e., time block) for fleet selectivity, a recent five year average weight-at-age (and similarly fecundity),
and average recruitment. A suite of data and model structure sensitivities were conducted to examine the influence of individual data sources and base model robustness and stability. While base model results capture parametric uncertainty and sensitivity evaluations explore structural uncertainty, total uncertainty is underestimated in current stock size and status because this approach does not account for the interaction between them or all possible alternative model structures for `r spp` population dynamics. 

## Stock Output and Dynamics {-}

For the purposes of this assessment, female spawning biomass is assumed to be proportional to egg and larval production (i.e., spawning output) and the terms spawning biomass and spawning output are used interchangeably through the report. Spawning output is reported in metric tons (mt) throughout.

Overall, `r spp` stock size and relative stock status have generally declined (at different rates) over time until a recent rapid increase due to several above average recruitment years (@tbl-es-sb; @fig-es-sb). Sablefish were exploited at relatively modest levels from the early 1900s to the mid-1970s, resulting in a gradual decline in spawning output from the equilibrium unfished level. Estimates of spawning output declined rapidly from the mid-1970s to the early 2000s as a result of higher than average harvest and modest recruitment. As annual harvest levels subsided to more moderate levels, spawning output generally leveled off from 2000--2017 in the range of 10 to 20 percent relative stock status (below the minimum stock size threshold; @fig-es-depl). Since 2017, spawning output is estimated to have continually increased through 2025 to the highest spawning output size since 1989. This rapid increase in spawning output is due to several above average recruitment years since 2013. The summary biomass of fish age 3 and older has a steeper increase at the end of the time series from both the 2020 and 2021 strong cohorts. Although the relative trend in spawning output is robust to uncertainty in the leading model parameters, the productivity of the stock remains a key source of uncertainty due to confounding of natural mortality, absolute stock size, and productivity (e.g., steepness). 

The estimate of 2025 female spawning output is `r sb_final` mt with 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals from 59,331 to 89,486 mt (@tbl-es-sb). The estimate of the 2025 stock status (i.e., the spawning output at the start 2025 divided by that at unfished equilibrium, *B~0~*) is `r depl_final*100` percent (@tbl-es-sb). However, the uncertainty covers 27.6 to 40.2 percent, partly due to remaining unknowns about the absolute size of recent, potentially large, recruitment events. The estimated trajectory of relative spawning output across the time series includes fishing the stock down to below the minimum stock stock size threshold and then rebounding to the precautionary zone after an extended period of reduced harvest (relative to time series maximums) and good recruitment (@fig-es-depl) .

## Recruitment {-}

Sablefish recruitment is estimated to be quite variable with large amounts of uncertainty in individual
recruitment events (@tbl-es-recr; @fig-es-recruits). In general, `r spp` has low to moderate recruitment
(relative to the long-term average) with occasional large year classes (aligning with assumed high recruitment variability: `r sigma_r`).
Initial model explorations found that there was limited information in the data to inform annual recruitment deviations prior to 1975, so recruitment
deviations were not estimated prior to 1975 (@fig-es-recdevs).

Absolute recruitment was generally low during the 1980s--2000s when spawning output was decreasing reaching low levels by 2000. After that time, several average to
well above average recruitment events occurred, including the highest four recruitment events in the time series falling between 2016--2023.
Years with the highest recruitment deviations were estimated to have occurred in `r top_recdevs[1, "years"]`, `r top_recdevs[2, "years"]`, `r top_recdevs[3, "years"]`, `r top_recdevs[4, "years"]`, and `r top_recdevs[5, "years"]`. The lowest annual recruitment deviations (e.g., negative deviations) were estimated to have occurred in `r low_recdevs[1, "years"]`, `r low_recdevs[2, "years"]`, `r low_recdevs[3, "years"]`, `r low_recdevs[4, "years"]`, and `r low_recdevs[5, "years"]`.
The estimated annual recruitment deviation in 2024 is uncertain, but estimated to be above average based upon data from the WCGBTS and the recruitment index.
The series of large recruitment from 2013 onwards is a major contributor to the rapid increase in spawning output and, in particular, summary biomass (ages 3 plus) over the last 8--10 years.

## Exploitation Status {-}

The estimated relative fishing intensity on the stock was at or above the current management target of 1.0 from 1982 to 2018 (@tbl-es-spr; @fig-es-spr). Since that time, fishing intensity has been below 1.0, declining to 0.70 by 2024 with 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals from 0.58 to 0.82. Here, fishing intensity is reported as a the ratio of one minus the spawning potential ratio to one minus the SPR target of 45 percent, or (1-SPR)/(1-SPR~45%~). The estimated exploitation rate (catch divided by biomass of fish of age-3 and above) for the most recent year was the lowest in the previous decade at 0.03 (@tbl-es-spr). Exploitation rate has fallen faster than relative fishing intensity in recent years because recent large recruitments are already contributing to age 3 plus biomass (exploitation) but have not all yet reached the age of maturity (approximately 6 to 10 years) to contribute to spawning potential (relative fishing intensity).

## Ecosysystem Consideration {-}

The climate vulnerability analysis for the California Current [@McClure:2023:VCC] suggests that processes affecting sablefish recruitment are sensitive to climatic and, therefore, oceanic drivers. Given the high climate vulnerability of sablefish, changes in their abundance, productivity, and spatial distribution are likely, and these changes are in turn likely to impact fishing fleets and communities because of the high value of this fishery. Strong coastwide recruitment appears to be associated with good recruitment north of Cape Mendocino (approximately 40$^\circ$ N. latitude), which itself is correlated with transport and temperature in the northern portion (40$^\circ$–48$^\circ$ N. latitude) of the U.S. West Coast, specifically with the northern transport of yolk-sac larvae [@tolimieri2018oceanographic]. A subsequent analysis conducted for this assessment evaluated the relationship between a suite of environmental indicators derived from oceanographic models and `r spp` recruitment found several predictors that explain variation around the stock–recruitment curve (see Section \ref{rec-index-data} and Appendix \ref{rec-appendix} for further details). These predictors were used to construct a recruitment index, which was used in the base model to provide additional information on the strength of recent recruitments (2020--2024). Other environmental considerations incorporated into the assessment model as input data directly include: the use of empirical weight-at-age data to account for latent environmental effects on spatiotemporal growth patterns; and the use of a spatially-integrated maturity schedule to account for latent environmental effects on latitudinal gradients in `r spp` maturity. 

Additional ecosystem and environmental considerations are explicit part of the risk table presented at the end of the executive summary (and in Section \ref{risk}). The 2024-2025 [California Current Ecosystem Status Report](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2025/02/f-1-a-cciea-report-1-2024-2025-california-current-ecosystem-status-report.pdf/) further describes the primary climate and ocean patterns that `r spp` encounter, as well as changes in `r spp` distribution, juvenile abundance indices, and trends in `r spp` primary prey and predators. The occurrence of `r spp` in the California Current has generally shifted northward over the past ten years. Recent observed environmental and biological conditions suggest that `r spp` could be larger and closer to shore than during average conditions.

## Reference Points {-}

cat(a, sep = '\n')
```

The estimated `r end_year` spawning output relative to unfished of equilibrium spawning output is `r depl_final*100` percent, below the management target of 40 percent of unfished spawning output. The fishing intensity is estimated to be below the current management harvest rate limit ($\text{SPR}_{45\%}$) at the end of the time series but is estimated to have been above between the 1970s to the late-2010s (@fig-es-spr). The interaction between the relative spawning output and the ratio of the estimated \gls{spr} to the management target ($\text{SPR}_{45\%}$) indicates that the stock is in the lower quadrant indicating that the overfishing is not occurring and that relative spawning output is below the management targets (@fig-es-spr-phase). The current estimate of stock status is larger than the \gls{msy}, below the \gls{spr} target and relative target biomass reference points (@fig-es-yield).

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distributions among fleets in the final year of the model, `r end_year` (@tbl-ref-points-es). The estimated sustainable total yield inclusive of both landings and discards was `r catch_spr` mt according to $\text{SPR}_{45\%}$. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of unfished spawning output ($\text{SB}_{40\%}$) calculated using the SPR target, $\text{SPR}_{45\%}$, was `r sb_spr` mt.

## Management Performance {-}

Sablefish management includes a rich history of seasons, size-limits, trip-limits, and a complex permit system. `r Spp` is currently modeled as a coastwide stock with corresponding coastwide \gls{ofl} and \gls{abc}. The coastwide \gls{abc} is then apportioned into two area-specific \glsplural{acl} north and south of 36$^\circ$ N. latitude. This historical management line corresponds with a recent data-driven analysis of `r spp` growth that suggests a difference in growth rates north and south of $36^\circ$ N. latitude [@kapur_oceanographic_2020]. The coastwide \gls{ofl} and \gls{abc} values and the area-based \gls{acl} are shown in @tbl-es-management.

For the 2019 assessment, the \gls{pfmc} adopted a methodology to determine the area-based \gls{acl} using a five-year rolling average relative biomass estimate from the WCGBTS ([November 2019 \gls{pfmc} Meeting Decision Document](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2019/11/november-2019-decision-document.pdf/)). The relative biomass estimates represent the distribution of the `r spp` population observed by the WCGBTS, not the entire population.  

The proportion of biomass observed by the WCGBTS north and south of 36$^\circ$ N. latitude for the most recent five years is shown in @tbl-es-prop-area.

## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables {-}

The projection of spawning output, stock status, and harvest limits were developed using the base model. The total catches in `r end_year` and `r end_year + 1` were fixed at `r fixed_catch[1]` and `r fixed_catch[2]` mt, respectively, based on recommendations from the \gls{gmt} (@tbl-es-gmt-catch). The \gls{abc} values were projected assuming a category 1 time-varying sigma with an initial value of 0.50 in 2027 and a management risk tolerance (P$^*$) of 0.45.  

The catches during the projection period, `r end_year + 2`--`r end_year + 12` were set equal to the year-specific \glsplural{abc} (@tbl-es-projections). The spawning output and stock status increase during the projection due to the estimated large recruitments in 2020, 2021, and 2023 maturing and entering the spawning population, resulting in future \glsplural{ofl} and \glsplural{abc}.

Two alternative catch streams based upon two options for P$^*$, 0.45 and 0.40, were created for the decision table (@tbl-es-decision-table). Each alternative catch stream assumes a category 1 time varying sigma with an initial value of 0.50 in 2027.  The axes of uncertainty in the decision table are based on the uncertainty around natural mortality. The low state of nature assumed a higher natural mortality of 0.095 yr$^{-1}$ and the high state of nature assumed a lower natural mortality of 0.070 yr$^{-1}$.  The low and high state of nature were run in a deterministic manner where they assumed the same parameter values, including annual recruitment deviations, as the base model except for natural mortality.

## Risk Table {-}

Oceanographers and stock assessment scientists jointly constructed a risk table to identify the main ecosystem and environmental processes for `r spp` that should be considered in conjunction with available data used in the stock assessment and the structural uncertainty embedded in the assessment (@tbl-risk-table-es). The group considered ecosystem and environmental indicators for `r spp` recruitment, habitat, prey, predators, competitors, and the recent climate vulnerability assessment [@McClure:2023:VCC]. Overall, the group considered these conditions to generally be neutral (Level 2) when considering, among other things, unresolved uncertainty with linkages between trends in primary predators and competitors and a overall climate vulnerability score of moderate.
Data inputs for `r spp` were scored as favorable (Level 1) given confidence in historical catch reconstructions, a comprehensive and representative survey index of abundance (WCGBTS), well sampled age data beginning at age zero, an informative recruitment index, and information on time- (growth) and -spatially-varying (maturity) life history characteristics across the stock range. The ability for the stock assessment model to fit the data and capture key sources of structural uncertainty was also scored as favorable (Level 1). Despite the need to fix certain productivity parameters (e.g., steepness and recruitment variability) or simplify some assumptions (e.g., sex invariant *M* and no net loss from emigration or immigration), model complexity seemed to balance well potential bias and variance in a way that stabilized `r spp` population dynamics across a wide breadth of alternative data and model structures (see Section \ref{sensitivities} for sensitivity evaluations).

Accounting for each factor considered in the risk table, the overall conditions for sablefish is currently considered favorable which could support the application of scientific uncertainty ($\sigma$) lower than the default ($\sigma$ of 0.50) for a category one assessment for projecting future harvest specifications. @tbl-es-risk-table-projections shows an theoretical projection using a $\sigma$ of 0.25 and a P* of 0.45 that could be considered if the use of risk tables is adopted by management for future stock assessments and a $\sigma$ of 0.25 is deemed appropriate by the Scientific and Statistical Committee.
