# Introduction

`r Spp` (*Anoplopoma fimbria*, also known as black cod) are distributed in the northeastern Pacific Ocean from the southern tip of Baja California northward to the north-central Bering Sea and in the northwestern Pacific Ocean from Kamchatka southward to the northeastern coast of Japan [@hart_pacific_1973; @eschmeyer_field_1983]. U.S. West Coast `r spp` are modeled as a single stock. Thus, this stock assessment does not explicitly account for movement between offshore sea mounts [@shaw_movement_1997; @morita_sex_2012; @hanselman_move_2015], regions to the north of the U.S. west coast, or to the western Pacific [@fujioka_description_1988; @heifetz_movement_1991; @hanselman_move_2015].

While previous analyses suggests the existence of several stocks of `r spp` in the eastern Pacific Ocean that are largely delineated by management boundaries (-@shirripa_sablefish_2007; and earlier assessments), more recent genetic analyses found that `r spp` in the northeastern Pacific Ocean are a single panmictic population [@jasonowicz_love_2017]. Additional support for a panmictic population stems from tag recoveries that show `r spp` move between the regions currently used for management [@hanselman_move_2015; @sogard_patterns_2017]. Analyses of length-at-age data has found spatial variation in von Bertalanffy growth parameters across the northeastern Pacific Ocean [@mcdevitt_status_1987; @echave_interdecadal_2012; @head_maturity_2014; @gertseva_spatial_2017; @kapur_oceanographic_2020]. While geographic break points at approximately (1) 36$^\circ$ N. lat. between Point Conception and Monterey, California at the start of the southern California Bight and (2) 50$^\circ$ N. lat. where the North Pacific Current bifurcates suggest zones of growth variation, generally with increasing maximum body size and decreasing growth rates with increasing latitude, they do not indicate regions with separate populations.

Smaller `r spp` are generally found in shallower waters, but the demographics appears to be fully mixed (adult and juvenile) near the shelf-slope break (i.e., 100-300 m). Beyond the shelf-slope break, the adult population is dominated by older individuals [@methot_assessment_1994] and younger fish become increasingly rare. Fish in the deepest areas sampled tend to be the oldest individuals, but not the largest individuals, suggesting that age rather than size dictates depth distribution. However, the interaction between environmental conditions and seasonal movements that produce an increase in age with depth are largely unknown. The stock is distributed beyond the greatest depth sampled by any of the surveys and beyond the deepest commercial fishing areas. Research in these deeper habitats occupied by `r spp` is potentially difficult because they extend across the boundary of the exclusive economic zone and sea mounts and ridges around the Pacific. There are relatively fewer `r spp` in the Puget Sound and the Strait of Georgia than in coastal U.S. waters. Therefore, connectivity among these areas and the open coast is likely of less importance to this stock assessment than movement along the coast.

## Life History

@tolimieri_oceanographic_2018 provide a thorough review of the literature on spawning and early life history of `r spp` in the California Current. Briefly, `r spp` off the U.S. West Coast exhibit a protracted spawning period from December through March, with peak in February [@guzman_reproductive_2017]. This winter-time spawning may result in reduced availability to the commercial fishery during the winter months. Spawning occurs along the continental shelf-slope break in waters deeper than 300 m. Eggs (~2.1 mm in diameter) are buoyant and rise in the water column before hatching and sinking to deeper waters. Pelagic juveniles are present in off-shore surface waters and settle to the benthos as age-0 recruits during the late summer to fall, with most newly settled fish at depths of less than 250 m. 

`r Spp` reach full size and maturity in their first decade of life, reaching nearly asymptotic size and beginning to mature after 5-7 years. Female `r spp` generally reach larger sizes than males. However, the sex-ratio tends to be skewed toward males at the oldest ages implying a lower natural mortality rate for males relative to females. The oldest `r spp` on record was captured in 2006 off Washington and aged (with observation error) at 102 years. This female was only 68 cm long, nowhere near the longest individual (117 cm).

Adult `r spp` are fast-swimming and capable of feeding on a diverse array of prey species including fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans [@low_sablefish_1976]. The cohabitation of adult and juvenile `r spp` may result in some cannibalism, and large changes in predator biomass (such as the recent rebuilding of lingcod, *Ophiodon elongatus*, could have a feedback on juvenile survival and, therefore, stock productivity.


## Fishery Description

Historical `r spp` landings, beginning in 1890, have been reconstructed by the states (Washington, Oregon, and California) using a variety of sources. Generally, historical `r spp` landings were more reliable than those for many other groundfish species because of their consistent species-level identification. While `r spp` landings were recorded back to the beginning of the 20th century, appreciable quantities were not landed until 1916-1919, with landings remaining below 5,000 metric tons (mt) through the late 1960s. Landings prior to 1960 were primarily harvested by hook-and-line gear. The peak around World War II was likely due to a relaxed degree of species sorting rather than a dramatic increase in fishing effort (i.e., grey literature notes a decrease in manpower with the onset of the war), where increases in demand were fueled by the need for domestic sources of protein [@browning_fisheries_1980].

The `r spp` fishery increased dramatically during the 1970s, first from a combination of foreign vessels [@lynde_historical_1986; @mcdevitt_status_1987], followed by an increase in the domestic fleet. Increases correspond to the introduction of a pot fishery followed by an increase in the catch coming from the trawl sector, with only minor increases in the hook-and-line sector until the mid-1980s, after the peak removals from the other sectors. Large catches by foreign vessels, fishing pot gear, resulted in the large removals of over 24,000 mt in 1976 and 1979 from U.S. West Coast waters. A rapid rise in domestic pot and trawl landings followed these peak removals, with landings in the 1980s slowly declining from around 19,000 mt in 1982 to ~9,000 mt in 1990. The decline in domestic landings through the 1980s was likely due to a combination of declining stock size, many years with below average recruitment, reduced Asian-market strength, and increasing fishery regulations. During the most recent decade, annual landings have remained below 6,500 mt, divided approximately 43 percent by hook-and-line, 26 percent by pot, and 30 percent by trawl gear during the last ten years. 

Between 2003 and 2010 the trawl logbook and Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) data show the fishery was distributed widely across the continental shelf from approximately 40$^{\circ}$ N. lat. to the U.S. Canadian border, with fishing effort distributed towards deeper waters south of the 40$^{\circ}$ N. lat. line and limited effort south of the 36$^{\circ}$ N. lat. management line. With the beginning of the catch shares program in 2011, the trawl logbook and WCGOP data show the fishery shifted its distribution towards deeper waters with greatly decreased effort in California.

During 2003 through 2017 WCGOP data show the non-catch shares fixed-gear fishery had a more patchy distribution compared to the trawl fishery (data from logbooks), with hook-and-line fishing effort extending into waters south of Point Conception while pot fishing effort was largely concentrated off of the coasts of Washington and Oregon. Since the inception of the catch shares program in 2011, the WCGOP data show that catch shares vessels fishing with hook-and-line gears are distributed to the north and focused on limited spatial regions with little effort in waters south of 40$^{\circ}$ N. lat., while catch shares vessels fishing with pots have expanded into waters south of 36$^{\circ}$ N. lat.

Gear switching within the individual fishing quota (IFQ) fishery increased after the implementation of the program, leading to concerns about utilization of the trawl allocation for sablefish north of 36 $^{\circ}$ N. lat. The majority of landings by vessels participating in gear switching was `r spp`.  At the April 2024 the Pacific Fishery Management Council (the Council) took final action to limit gear switching in years when `r spp` annual catch limit (ACL) for the area north of 36$^{\circ}$ N. lat. is below 6,000 mt. 

In 2024, the ex-vessel revenue of the `r spp` fishery was estimated at 13.5 million dollars, the lowest in available data starting in 2005 (pers. comm., E. Steiner). Since 2005, the ex-vessel revenue peaked 2011 at 61.5 million dollars and has generally had a decreasing trend since 2017.


## Management History and Performance

From the early 1900s to the early 1980s, management of the `r spp` fishery was the responsibility of the individual coastal states (California, Oregon, and Washington). Since the adoption of the Groundfish Fishery Management Plan by the Pacific Fisheries Management Council in 1982, responsibility has rested with the federal government and the Council. From 1977 to the mid-1980s, U.S. commercial fishermen took advantage of their newly protected fishing grounds (i.e., the enactment of the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, which occurred in in 1976, later to be renamed Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act) recording high catches of `r spp` to meet the demands of flourishing export (primarily Asian countries) and domestic markets.

The first coast-wide regulations off the U.S. Pacific Coast for the `r spp` fishery were implemented as trip limits in October 1982, followed by a rich history of management via seasons, size-limits, trip-limits, and a complex permit system. Beginning in 1983, additional trip limits were imposed on landings of `r spp` less than 22 inches in length, considered incidental catch. In 1987, allocations between the trawl and non-trawl fleets were implemented.

Beginning in the late-1980s, the fixed-gear `r spp` fishery was managed as a `derby' fishery, characterized by increasing reductions in season lengths. In 1991, the fully open season lasted seven weeks, from April 1 through May 23. In 1992, approximately 1,300 mt were landed under early season trip limits of up to 1,500 pounds per day, and the fully open season lasted from May 12 through May 26. In 1993, there was a 250 pounds per day trip limit prior to the open season which extended from May 12 through June 1. In 1994, the fully open season was shorted to May 15 through June 3. In 1995, the open season lasted one week, from August 3 to August 13. The open season spanned only six days in 1996, from September 1 to September 6. In 1997, nine days (August 25 to September 3) were set aside for the open season, with a mop-up period from October 1-15. In the more recent period, the Limited Entry Fixed Gear sector has been managed primarily through the use of tiered cumulative limits (allocated on the basis of historical landings) which can be landed throughout the 7-month season. The remaining open-access fishery and some limited-entry non-trawl vessels are allowed to make smaller landings that are subject to daily/weekly limits and two-month cumulative caps.

Additionally, `r spp` are harvested by the trawl fishery in association with a variety of other species that are distributed to domestic and foreign markets. Prior to 2011, the trawl fishery was managed primarily through the use of trip limits. These evolved from simple per-trip limits in the 1980s to cumulative periodic (monthly or bi-monthly) limits by the mid-1990s. In addition to `r spp`-specific limits, various limits were in place for the overall landings of deep-water complex species.

## Fisheries off Canada and Alaska

Similarly to the U.S. West Coast, `r spp` fisheries in Alaska and British Columbia waters began in the late 1800s, with generally low catches until after World War II. Foreign fisheries began exploiting `r spp` in the northeastern Pacific Ocean during the late 1950s in the Bering Sea leading to rapidly increasing catches in the region through the 1980s. 

Historically, Alaskan landings were much larger than those off the U.S. West Coast, rising to over 20,000 mt during the early 1960s, with many years above this level until the mid 1990s. 

The `r spp` fishery in the waters off British Columbia  has a similar history to those in U.S. waters. The fishery primarily uses pots, with a lesser amount landed using long lines and trawls. Landings ranged up to just over 7,000 mt during the mid-1970s, followed by a variable but generally declining trend through the present.
