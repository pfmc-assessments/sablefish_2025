## Stock Description

`r Spp` (*Anoplopoma fimbria*, also known as black cod) are distributed in the northeastern Pacific Ocean from the southern tip of Baja California northward to the north-central Bering Sea and in the northwestern Pacific Ocean from Kamchatka southward to the northeastern coast of Japan [@hart_pacific_1973; @eschmeyer_field_1983]. U.S. West Coast `r spp` are modeled as a single stock. Thus, this stock assessment does not explicitly account for movement between offshore sea mounts [@shaw_movement_1997; @morita_sex_2012; @hanselman_move_2015], regions to the north or south of the U.S. West Coast, or to the western Pacific [@fujioka_description_1988; @heifetz_movement_1991; @hanselman_move_2015]. The area included in this assessment is shown in @fig-map.

Previous analyses suggest the existence of several stocks of `r spp` in the eastern Pacific Ocean that are largely delineated by management boundaries (@shirripa_sablefish_2007; and earlier assessments), though more recent genetic analyses found that `r spp` in the northeastern Pacific Ocean are a single panmictic population [@jasonowicz_love_2017]. Additional support for a panmictic population stems from tag recoveries that show `r spp` move across international boundaries, including regions currently used for management [@hanselman_move_2015; @sogard_patterns_2017; @kapur_tag_2025]. Despite generally similar movement estimates between the U.S. West Coast and British Columbia, a net change in demography may still be present due to differences in area-specific population sizes [@kapur_range_2024]. Analyses of length-at-age data have found spatial variation in von Bertalanffy growth parameters across the northeastern Pacific Ocean [@mcdevitt_status_1987; @echave_interdecadal_2012; @head_maturity_2014; @gertseva_spatial_2017; @kapur_oceanographic_2020]. Geographic break points at approximately (1) 36$^\circ$ N. latitude between Point Conception and Monterey, California and (2) 50$^\circ$ N. latitude where the North Pacific Current bifurcates suggest zones of growth variation. However, increasing maximum body size and decreasing growth rates with increasing latitude do not indicate regions with separate populations.

Smaller `r spp` are generally found in shallower waters, but the demographics appear to be fully mixed (adult and juvenile) near the shelf-slope break (i.e., 100--300 m). Beyond the shelf-slope break, the population is dominated by older individuals [@methot_assessment_1994] and younger fish become increasingly rare. Fish in the deepest areas sampled tend to be the oldest but not the largest individuals, suggesting that age dictates depth-specific distributions. The interaction between environmental conditions and seasonal movements that produce an increase in age with depth are largely unknown. The stock is distributed beyond the greatest depths sampled by any of the surveys and beyond the deepest commercial fishing areas. Research in the deeper habitats occupied by `r spp` is potentially difficult because they extend across the boundary of the exclusive economic zone and near sea mounts and ridges across the Pacific Ocean. There are relatively fewer `r spp` in the Puget Sound and Strait of Georgia than in coastal U.S. waters. Therefore, connectivity among these areas and the open coast is likely of less importance to this stock assessment than movement along the coast.

## Life History

@tolimieri_oceanographic_2018 provide a thorough review of the literature on spawning and early life history of `r spp` in the California Current. Briefly, `r spp` off the U.S. West Coast spawn along the continental shelf-slope break in waters deeper than 300 m and exhibit a protracted spawning period from December through March, with peak activity in February [@guzman_reproductive_2017]. Spawning in deeper waters may result in reduced availability to the commercial fishery during the winter months. Eggs (~2.1 mm in diameter) are buoyant and sink to deeper waters after hatching. Pelagic juveniles are present in off-shore surface waters and settle to the benthos as age-0 recruits during the late summer and fall, with most newly settled fish observed at depths less than 250 m. 

`r Spp` reach asymptotic size and mature between 5-11 years [@head_maturity_2014]. Female `r spp` generally reach larger sizes than males. The sex-ratio tends to be skewed toward males at the oldest ages, implying higher fishing pressure on females, a lower natural mortality rate for males, or sex-specific longevity and selectivity. The oldest `r spp` observed off the West Coast as captured off Washington in 2006and aged (with observation error) at 102 years. 

Adult `r spp` are fast-swimming and capable of feeding on a diverse array of prey species including fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans [@low_sablefish_1976]. The cohabitation of adult and juvenile `r spp` may result in some cannibalism, and large changes in predator biomass could have a negative effect on juvenile survival and, therefore, stock productivity.

## Ecosystem Considerations

The sablefish \gls{cva} suggests that processes affecting recruitment are sensitive to environmental drivers [@mcclure_2023_vulnerability]. Climate-driven changes in the abundance, productivity, and spatial distribution of sablefish are likely and can have considerable impacts to fishing fleets and communities because of the high value of this fishery. The \gls{cva} also suggests that sablefish are likely to shift their distribution in response to climate variability.

The sablefish stock has experienced latitudinal shifts in the center of the distribution of stock biomass within the California Current, which has affected fishing opportunities to individual ports [@selden_2019]. The population centroid shifted to the north from 1980 to 1992, to the south by 2013, and back to the north in recent years, illustrated by an increase in \gls{s-wcgbt} biomass estimates.

Strong coast-wide recruitment appears to be associated with strong recruitment north of Cape Mendocino (~ 40$^\circ$ N. latitude). Strong recruitment is correlated with larval transport and temperature in the northern portion of the U.S. West Coast (40$^\circ$--48$^\circ$ N. latitude) [@tolimieri2018]. Variation around the stock-recruitment curve was negatively correlated with sea level north of Cape Mendocino, CA. The 2019 assessment of sablefish included a sea surface height index within the model to inform historical and recent recruitment [@haltuch_status_2019]. This assessment includes a revised recruitment index that accounts for several oceanographic and ecosystem variables that appear to be correlated with sablefish recruitment in recent years (see Section \ref{rec-index-data} for additional information).

Age-0 sablefish captured by the \gls{s-wcgbt} were most abundant in shelf and upper-slope waters around San Francisco Bay and from Cape Mendocino to the Columbia River. The abundance of age-0 recruits varied through time with peaks in recruitment in 2008, 2013, 2016, 2020, 2021, and 2023. Most strong recruitment years were associated with high recruitment north of Cape Mendocino. Recent modeling work suggests that strong age-0 recruitment is associated, in part, with the northward transport of yolk-sac larvae at depths between 1,000--1,200 m [@tolimieri2018], which may lead to grearter spatiotemporal overlap between feeding larvae and copepod prey than when larval transport is not as well defined.


## Fishery Description

Historical `r spp` landings, beginning in 1890, have been reconstructed by the states (Washington, Oregon, and California) using a variety of sources. Generally, historical `r spp` landings were more reliable than those for many other groundfish species because of consistent species-level identification. Although `r spp` landings were recorded at the start of the 20th century, appreciable quantities were not landed until 1916--1919, with landings remaining below 5,000 mt through the late 1960s. Landings prior to 1960 were primarily harvested by hook-and-line gear. 

Sablefish landings increased dramatically during the 1970s, first from a combination of foreign vessels [@lynde_historical_1986; @mcdevitt_status_1987], followed by an increase in the domestic fleet. Increases in catch correspond to the introduction of a pot fishery, followed by the trawl sector, with only minor increases in hook-and-line catches until the mid-1980s. Over 25,000 mt of `r spp` were removed in 1976 and 1979 from U.S. West Coast waters. A rapid increase in domestic pot and trawl landings followed these peak removals, with slow declines from ~ 19,000 mt in 1982 to ~ 9,000 mt in 1990. This decline in domestic landings was likely due to a combination of declining stock size, reduced Asian-market strength, and stricter fishery regulations. Annual landings have remained below 6,500 mt over the past decade, with approximately 43% of removals from hook-and-line, 26% by pot, and 30% by trawl gear. 

An \gls{ifq} program was implemented off the U.S. West Coast in 2011. Sablefish are targeted by \gls{ifq} vessels using varying gear types. Gear switching within the \gls{ifq} fishery increased after the implementation of the program, leading to concerns about utilization of the trawl allocation for `r spp` north of 36$^{\circ}$ N. latitude. The majority of landings by vessels participating in gear switching was `r spp`. At the April 2024 meeting, the \gls{pfmc} took final action to limit gear switching in years when `r spp` \gls{acl} for the area north of 36$^{\circ}$ N. latitude is below 6,000 mt. 

In 2024, the ex-vessel revenue of the `r spp` fishery was estimated at 13.5 million USD, the lowest estimate since 2005 (pers. comm., E. Steiner, \gls{nwfsc}). Since 2005, the ex-vessel revenue peaked at 61.5 million U.S. dollars in 2011 and has generally declined since 2017.


## Management History and Performance

From the early 1900s to the early 1980s, management of the `r spp` fishery was the responsibility of individual coastal states (California, Oregon, and Washington). Since the adoption of the Groundfish \gls{fmp} by the \gls{pfmc} in 1982, responsibility has rested with the federal government and the \gls{pfmc}. From 1977 to the mid-1980s, U.S. commercial fishermen took advantage of their newly protected fishing grounds (resulting from the enactment of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act in 1976), recording high catches of `r spp` to meet the demands of flourishing exports (primarily to Asian countries) and domestic markets.

The first coastwide regulations off the U.S. West Coast for the `r spp` fishery were implemented as trip limits in October 1982. This was followed by several management actions, including seasonal restrictions, size limits, trip limits, and a relatively complex permitting system. Beginning in 1983, additional trip limits were imposed on landings of `r spp` less than 22 inches in length, which were generally considered incidental. Trawl and non-trawl allocations were implemented in 1987.

Beginning in the late-1980s, the fixed-gear `r spp` fishery was managed as a `derby' fishery, characterized by relatively short seasons. In 1991, the fully open season lasted seven weeks, from April 1 through May 23. In 1992, approximately 1,300 mt were landed under early season trip limits, with up to 1,500 lb per day. The fully open season lasted from May 12 through May 26. In 1993, there was a 250 lb per day trip limit prior to the open season, which extended from May 12 through June 1. In 1994, the fully open season was restricted to May 15 through June 3. In 1995, the open season lasted one week, from August 3 to August 13. The open season spanned only six days in 1996, from September 1 to September 6. In 1997, nine days were set aside for the open season from August 25 to September 3, with a mop-up period from October 1 to October 15. More recently, the limited entry fixed gear sector has been managed primarily through the use of tiered cumulative limits (allocated on the basis of historical landings) for a 7-month season. The remaining open-access fishery and some limited-entry non-trawl vessels are allowed to make smaller landings that are subject to daily or weekly limits and 2-month cumulative caps.

In 2002 and 2003, the \gls{pfmc} enacted \gls{rca}, which were closed to fishing for certain gear types to support rebuilding of overfished rockfish species in specific areas along the West Coast. The boundaries of the \gls{rca} depended upon the fishing gear being used. At the start of 2024, restrictions for a considerable portion of \gls{rca} were lifted for non-trawl commercial and recreational vessels targeting groundfishes. 

`r Spp` are harvested by the trawl fishery in association with a variety of other species that are distributed to domestic and foreign markets. Prior to 2011 (with the introduction of the \gls{ifq}), the trawl fishery was managed primarily through the use of trip limits. These evolved from simple per-trip limits in the 1980s to cumulative periodic (monthly or bi-monthly) limits by the mid-1990s. Since 2011, \gls{ifq} vessels have operated using allocated quota pounds, whereas vessels operating in limited entry and open access sector are still managed using trip limits that restrict landings per week and per two month periods. A list of select management changes since 2010 is provided in Section \ref{ref-man-history}.

Currently, \gls{pfmc} manages `r spp` off the U.S. West using two areas, \gls{acl} north and south of 36$^\circ$ N. latitude. Management splits the coastwide \gls{abc} using the most recent 5-yr average of biomass estimates from the \gls{s-wcgbt}. 


## Fisheries off Canada and Alaska

Exploring regional trends in population dynamics can be a useful way to elicit patterns and gain insights, particularly for stocks such as `r spp` that span multiple management jurisdictions. Landings data, population dynamics trends, and stock status determinations are available in the most recent `r spp` stock assessments for the U.S. West Coast [@johnson_status_2023], British Columbia [@DFO2023], and Alaska [@Goethel_assess_2024]. Total landings of `r spp` has changed considerably over time for all three stock assessments. Similar to the U.S. West Coast, `r spp` fisheries in Alaska and British Columbia began in the late 1800s, with generally low catches until after World War II. Foreign fisheries began exploiting `r spp` in in the Bering Sea during the late 1950s, with rapidly increasing catches through the 1980s. All three stock assessments showed a general decline in catch during the 1990s and 2000s, though there has been a slight increase in catch in recent years, especially in Alaska and British Columbia. For comparison, catch in 2021 was nearly 22,000 mt in Alaska, 2,400 mt in British Columbia, and 5,000 mt along the U.S. West Coast. Landings peaked during the 1970s at > 50,000 mt in Alaska, > 7,000 mt in British Columbia, and > 25,000 mt along the U.S. West Coast. The `r spp` fishery off British Columbia primarily uses pots, with lower landings resulting from longlines and trawl gear. Historically, Alaskan landings have been much greater than those off the U.S. West Coast.

Spawning output in Alaska and British Columbia generally declined until the late 2010s, but are now rapidly increasing. The U.S. West Coast population generally declined from the 1970s to the early 2000s but was relatively stable through the late 2010s before increasing rapidly in recent years. There has been several strong recruitment events in all three stock assessments over the past 10 years. The three strongest recruitment events (all scaled to age-0) were similar in Alaska (2016, 2017, and 2019 cohorts), British Columbia (2015, 2016, and 2017), and along the U.S. West Coast (2016, 2020, and 2021). 

Overall, stock status (i.e., depletion, relative spawning output, fraction unfished) is estimated at 67% of equilibrium spawning output in Alaska (in 2024), 54% in British Columbia (2022), and `r depl_final*100`% for the U.S. West Coast. Stock status in all three regions can be generalized to indicate that overfishing is not occurring and that the stocks are not overfished. The sablefish stock in Alaska and British Columbia has been above fishing-based reference levels and below biomass-based reference levels at one point or another during the time series (@fig-reg-kobe). Recent strong recruitment events are driving the increase in spawning stock size over recent years for all three regions.
