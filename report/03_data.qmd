## Fishery-Dependent data

### Landings {#landings}

Landings for `r spp` comprise of various historical landings reconstructions, historical foreign fishery catch data, and commercial domestic landings data extracted from \gls{pacfin} on February, 25, 2025. In additin, Pacific hake at-sea fishery catches (provided by Vanessa Tuttle, \gls{nwfsc}, \gls{noaa}) and recreational landings were extracted from \gls{recfin} on February 28, 2025. The landings used in this assessment are shown in @fig-landings and @tbl-landings. 

The assessment model uses fishery catch data aggregated by gear-type and catch-type (landed or discarded) to define six fishery fleets: 1) trawl, 2) hook-and-line, 3) pot, 4) trawl discards, 5) hook-and-line discards, and 6) pot discards. Landings for fleets 1--3 are described here, and discards for fleets 4--6 are described in section \ref{discards}. The trawl fleet includes mortality from the domestic historical (pre-1981 in California and Washington, pre-1987 in Oregon) and current landings available in \gls{pacfin}, estimated foreign trawl catch, and  Pacific hake at-sea fishery total mortality estimates. The hook-and-line fleet includes mortality from the domestic historical (pre-1981 in California and Washington, pre-1987 in Oregon) and current landings available in \gls{pacfin}, estimated foreign hook-and-line total mortality, and recreational fisheries total mortality estimates. The pot fleet includes mortality from the domestic historical (pre-1981 in California and Washington, pre-1987 in Oregon) and current landings available in \gls{pacfin} and estimated foreign pot catch. 

For the state of California, commercial landings between 1900 and 1931 were calculated following the approach used in the 2011 and 2019 `r spp` assessments. Specifically, landings estimates from 1916--1931 were available from published California Department of Fish and Game Bulletins, 1908 to 1916 were based on Fisheries statistics of the U.S. published by the U.S. Fish Commission, and 1900--1907 were extrapolated linearly to zero from 1907 to 1900. Landings for the period 1931--1968 relied on estimates from the recent reconstruction efforts by scientists at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center and California Department of Fish and Game [@ralston_documentation_2010]. This effort utilized newly available spatial information regarding groundfish landings back to 1931. This method is an improvement for `r spp`, since it was identified as a separate market category. Landings between 1969--1977 were based on California fish tickets with a ratio estimator approach, and landings between 1978 to 1980 were pulled from the CALCOM database. Prior to 1969, the gear type associated with landings was not available so landings were allocated between trawl and hook-and-line gear based upon the proportions starting in 1969, with no landings assumed to be based on pot gear since the landings with pot gear were negligible (e.g., less than 0.5 mt in 1969 and 1970) until 1971. California commercial landings from 1981--2024 were extracted from \gls{pacfin}. 

Oregon landings reconstructions cover 1927 through 1986 [@karnowski_historical_2014]. @low_sablefish_1976 provided total landings from 1915 to 1926. No catch statistics were available prior to 1915, so a linear extrapolation from the 10 mt estimate for 1915 to 0 mt in 1891 was applied. Oregon landings from 1987 to 2024 were extracted from \gls{pacfin}. 

Washington completed a historical landings reconstruction for the 2019 assessment of `r spp`, which was used in this assessment as they represent the best scientific information available. The following information sources were included in the reconstruction: 1890 to 1908 from U.S. Fish Commission Bulletin; 1915 to 1952 from PMFC Bulletin 3, Appendix (page 130, using a conversion factor of 1.75 for dressed fish); 1953 to 1969 from the Washington Statistical Bulletin; and 1970 to 1980 from the Washington fish ticket database. Landings area assignments were based on Seattle market reports and Washington Statistical Bulletins. Gear type was based on PMFC Bulletin 3 (page 44, Table 2) and Washington Statistical Bulletins. Washington landings between 1981 to 2024 were extracted from \gls{pacfin}.

This assessment also included data on catch of `r spp` by the Pacific hake at-sea fishery since 1978. The 2023 assessment of `r spp` only included estimates going back to 1990. This assessment extends the at-sea catches to the first year of available catch data, 1978. Across most years, the catch of `r spp` in the Pacific hake at-sea fishery is relatively low, particularly when compared to the magnitude of landings from other groundfish sectors contained in \gls{pacfin}. However, there have been select years where the catch of `r spp` in this fishery has been higher than average. Catch was high between 1979 and 1982 ranging between 103 mt to 359 mt. In recent years, high catch in the Pacific hake at-sea fishery is likely driven by strong recruitment events with 153 mt and 117 mt of incidental catch in 2017 and 2018, respectively, and 306 mt and 161 mt in 2022 and 2023. The estimates provided from the \gls{ashop} included both discarded and retained catch of `r spp` and were included in this assessment in the trawl fleet. 

Foreign catches are included in gear-specific fleets. The foreign catch reconstructions were based on the records in the historical annotated landings (HAL) database [@lynde_historical_1986]. The catch by foreign vessels was very high in the late 1970s, relative to domestic fleets during that time. Previous assessments included the foreign catches in the corresponding landings gear fleet, which resulted in additional mortality being estimated (i.e., treated as if the estimates were landings not catches that accounted for total mortality). @lynde_historical_1986 indicated that foreign catches account for both landings and discards, thus these estimates were treated as separate catch fleets for this assessment.    

Recreational fishery landings were added to the hook-and-line landings fleet. Recreational landings of `r spp` were historically low, with the average mortality < 3 mt per year between 2001 and 2022. However, recreational landings have sharply increased in recent years. For example, coastwide recreational mortality peaked at 34 mt in 2023 and was 29 mt in 2024. 

A comparison between the total mortality from this assessment and the estimated total mortality from the previous assessment is shown in @fig-landings-comparison. 

### Discards {#discards}

This assessment included discard fleets for each gear type. Estimates of discard mortality were based on historical information (when available) and current discard practices by fleet. Discard mortality was estimated using \gls{pfmc} adopted gear-specific discard mortality rates of 20% for fixed gear and 50% for trawl gear. Previous assessments of sablefish assumed the same discard mortality rates. The discard fleet mortality was calculated for the domestic commercial landings only (e.g., historical commercial reconstructions and landings in \gls{pacfin}). 

The calculated discard mortality used \gls{wcgop} gear-specific annual discard rates and discard mortality rates multiplied by the corresponding domestic landings in \gls{pacfin} (2002 to 2023). The discard mortality prior to 2002 for hook-and-line and pot gear was calculated using the average gear-specific discard rate between 2002 to 2010 and the discard mortality rate multiplied by the domestic year-specific landings from 1890 to 2001 (e.g., landings in \gls{pacfin} and the historical catch reconstructions). The discard mortality for trawl gear prior to 2002 was based on the average of discard rates observed in the Pikitch data (1985 to 1987) and the discard mortality rate multiplied by the domestic year-specific landings from 1890 to 2001.  The discard mortality in 2024 was calculated by using the gear-specific discard rate for 2023. No discard mortality was assumed between 1942 and 1946 during World War II.  

The estimation of the gear-specific annual discard rates for `r spp` comes from multiple sources of data. A trawl discard study conducted from 1985 to 1987, referred to as the "Pikitch study", organized by Ellen Pikitch resulted in discard rates and length observations for various groundfish species including `r spp` [@pikitch_evaluation_1988]. The boundaries of the study were primarily within the Columbia \gls{inpfc} area off Oregon and Washington [@pikitch_evaluation_1988; @rogers_numerical_1992]. Participation in the Pikitch study was voluntary and included vessels that used bottom, midwater, and shrimp trawl gear. Observers on commercial vessels collected the data, estimated the total weight of the catch by tow, and recorded the weight of species retained and discarded in the sample. Results from the Pikitch discard study were processed and provided by John Wallace (pers. comm., \gls{nwfsc}, \gls{noaa}) as ratios of discard weight to total weight (discard and retained) of `r spp`. 

The second source for discard data is from \gls{wcgop}. This program is part of the \gls{nwfsc} and has been recording discard observations starting in 2002. Since 2011, when the \gls{ifq} program was implemented, observer coverage rates increased to 100 percent for all the \gls{ifq} vessels in the program (i.e., through 2023) and discard rates within this sector declined compared to pre-2011 rates. Discard rates were obtained for both the \gls{ifq} (observed and electronic monitored vessels) and other sectors (e.g., open access, limited entry, etc.) for `r spp`. A single discard rate was calculated by weighting discard rates based on the commercial discards between the \gls{ifq} and other sectors and gears based on landings estimates from the \gls{gemm} report. This assessment estimated a single discard rate for each gear type using a data weighting approach based upon the landings between sectors.  This approach to calculating discard rates is considered to be an improvement compared to approaches used in previous assessments for sablefish. The discard rates from both data sources by fleet based on gear type are shown in @tbl-discard-rates-twl -- @tbl-discard-rates-pot.  

\gls{wcgop} collects biological data for observed discards from the commercial fishery. For sablefish, only length data were available from \gls{wcgop}. This assessment uses an empirical weight-at-age approach to account for time-varying changes in growth, requiring all composition data to be age-based (see Section \ref{watage} for details). A length-age key that accounts for the year and area of collection (north or south of 36$^\circ$ N latitude) was used to estimate age from observed discard length. The `FSA` package in `R` was used to convert lengths to ages. The package calculates the probability that a fish is a particular age given its length. Data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} was used to inform the estimated length-age probabilities since this data source includes annual data with spatial locations (@fig-alk). The estimated ages were expanded to the tow level and then aggregated annually for each gear type. The estimated ages were then used to inform the estimation of selectivity for each of the gear-specific discard fleets. 

The aggregated discard ages by gear type are shown in @fig-data-agg-ages. Discard ages by gear and year are shown in @fig-discard-ages-trawl -- @fig-discard-ages-pot. Generally, trawl fleets discard younger fish compared to the other gear types, with hook-and-line and pot gear discarding a wider range of ages. 

### Composition Data {#fishery-bds-data}

Composition data for all states were extracted from the \gls{pacfin} Biological Data System. The weighting of commercial biological samples was conducted using the `R` package \href{https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/pacfintools}{\texttt{pacfintool}} developed and managed by scientists at the \gls{nwfsc}. This package queries, filters, and expands fishery biological data based on the following steps:

\begin{enumerate} 
\item Expand the sample weight of lengths or ages from the state recorded sub-sample, consisting of one or more baskets of fish, to the estimated total landings in that market category (or trip for ungraded samples). When sample weights were unavailable, sex-specific weight-length relationships were used to approximate the weight of the sample. 
\item Sum the trip-expanded values within model-based gear fleets and state combinations. Data sampled from larger landings thus account for more weight in the sum to better reflect the total landings.
\item Expand the values to gear-specific landings, ensuring that data by state are expanded based upon the total landings within that state.
\item Calculate input sample sizes based upon the number of trips and samples.
\end{enumerate}

The input sample sizes for each fleet in the model were calculated as:

\begin{centering}

Input N = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input N = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}

Commercial length data are available in \gls{pacfin} starting in 1974. Commercial age data are available starting in 1983. This assessment incorporated only commercial age data to estimate the age distribution of removals by gear type. Initial investigation into the available age data identified a number of age samples that did not appear to be used in the 2019 assessment. Comparisons between the number of age samples by year for trawl and fixed gear (e.g., hook-and-line and pot combined based on the previous assessment) are shown in @tbl-twl-age-samples-comp -- @tbl-fixed-age-samples-comp. Most of the omitted ages were from Oregon and were excluded because no ageing method was recorded or because samples were obtained from special projects. The \gls{cap} confirmed that the method used to age sablefish has not changed throughout the time series. Given this, the ages without an ageing method denoted in \gls{pacfin} are likely break-and-burn reads and should be included in the assessment. In 2019, scientists at the \gls{nwfsc} noticed that there were a number of data records in Oregon marked as "special samples" in early years of available data. After working with data experts at \gls{odfw}, these data were identified as having been collected as random samples of market category fish and thus should be included in assessments. 

The total number of ages, trips, and calculated input sample sizes are shown by year and gear type in @tbl-twl-age-samples, @tbl-hkl-age-samples, and @tbl-pot-age-samples. Across all years, 28%, 50%, and 22% of all age data arise from California, Oregon, and Washington, respectively. By gear, 57% of available age data are from the trawl fleet, 32% from hook-and-line gear, and 11% from pot gear. The trawl fleet tends to catch younger fish compared to hook-and-line and pot gear (@fig-data-agg-ages). Age compositions from hook-and-line and pot gear are similar, with higher proportions of female fish compared to male fish. Age data by year from the trawl fleet are shown in @fig-data-trawl, hook-and-line in @fig-data-hkl, and pot in @fig-data-pot.

## Fishery-Independent Data

Historically, data from four research surveys have provided fishery-independent information about the abundance, distribution, and biological characteristics of `r spp`. The longest time series of fishery-independent data arises from the \gls{s-wcgbt} survey, which began in 2003 and ends in 2024 for this assessment. This annual survey (excluding 2020 due to COVID-19) samples shelf and slope habitats off the U.S. West Coast, covering depths from 55 to 1,280 m (30 to 700 fm), and is considered the best source of information for `r spp` popoulation trends. This assessment also used data from two additional fishery-independent surveys: \gls{s-nslope} and the \gls{s-tri}. Data from the \gls{s-aslope} has been used in previous assessments of sablefish but was excluded in this assessment due to issues surrounding age data (see Section \ref{data-not-used} for additional information). 

The indices from each fishery-independent data source used in this assessment were standardized for comparison by rescaling the index by its mean (i.e., each index centered around 1.0), as shown in @fig-index-stand.

### NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey {#wcgbt-data}

The \gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design that spans coastal waters from 55 to 1,280 m deep [@bradburn_2003_2011]. This survey generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year, each assigned to an approximately equal number of randomly selected grid cells that are divided into two ‘passes’ of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October (i.e., except for 2019, which had one vessel per pass). This design therefore incorporates vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability and variance estimates associated with selecting a relatively small number of cells (approximately 700) from a very large set of possible cells that span from the US-Mexico border to the US-Canada border.

`r Spp` are observed across the full range of latitudes (@fig-positive-lat-wcgbt) and depths (@fig-positive-depth-wcgbt) sampled by the \gls{s-wcgbt}. The sex ratio of positive tows is approximately 50:50 between depths of 55 to 400 m. More males are observed between 400 and 1,100 m, whereas more females are observed at the deepest depths (@fig-sex-ratio-wcgbt). Observed sizes and ages of sablefish are shown by latitude and depth in @fig-wcgbt-map-density. Generally, older sablefish are found at deeper depths and younger fish are more commonly observed from 55 to 500 m (@fig-wcgbt-depth-len-age). The observed fraction of females is shown by age and year in @fig-wcgbt-age-sex-ratio.

Geostatistical models of biomass density were fit to survey data using the R package \gls{sdmtmb} developed by @Anderson:2022:SRP. These models can account for latent spatial factors with a constant spatial Gaussian random field and spatiotemporal deviations to evolve as a random walk Guassian random field [@thorson_geostatistical_2015]. Tweedie, delta-binomial, delta-Gamma, and mixed distributions were investigated. Results are only shown for the distribution that led to the best model diagnostics (e.g., similar distributions of theoretical normal quantiles and model quantiles, high precision, lack of extreme predictions that are incompatible with life history traits, low \gls{aic}). Biomass from the best-fit model was predicted using a grid based on available survey locations. The \href{https://pfmc-assessments.github.io/indexwc/}{\texttt{indexwc}} and R package was used to conduct the analysis.

The best-fit model used a delta model with a Gamma distribution for the catch-rate component. A logit-link was used for encounter probability and a log-link for positive catch rates. The response variable was catch (mt) with an offset of area (km$^2$) to account for differences in effort. Fixed effects were estimated for each year. The survey pass was included as a covariate. Vessel-year effects, which were historically used for index standardization of this survey, were excluded because the estimated variance for the random effect was close to zero. Vessel-year effects were more prominent when models did not include spatial effects and instead vessel-year terms accounted for the random selection of commercial vessels used during sampling [@helser_generalized_2004; @thorson_accounting_2014]. Spatial and spatiotemporal variation were included in both the encounter probability and positive catch rate models. Spatial variation was approximated using 500 knots. The quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot for the delta-Gamma model is shown in @fig-qq-wcgbt. No spatial or spatiotemporal patterns were found in the Pearson residuals. The relative index of abundance for `r spp` decreased to the lowest levels between 2008 and 2010, began to slowly increase between 2011 and 2019, sharply increased from 2021 to 2022, and remained high in 2023 and 2024 (@fig-index-wcgbt). The estimated proportion of biomass observed by the \gls{s-wcgbt} north and south of 36$^\circ$ N latitude over the last five years of the survey are shown in @tbl-prop-area.

Length and age samples are collected by the \gls{s-wcgbt}. The length data were not used in this assessment. The age data were processed into bins from 0 to 50 years of age. Marginal age compositions were expanded to tow and strata levels (@tbl-wcgbt-strata). Input sample sizes for the marginal age compositions were calculated using a multiplier (e.g., 2.38) on the number of positive tows with age samples (@tbl-wcgbt-samples) based on research by @stewart_bootstrapping_2014. The ages aggregated over all years are shown in @fig-data-agg-ages and by year in @fig-data-wcgbt. The mean age by year with 95% confidence intervals based on current sample sizes is shown in @fig-data-wcgbt-mean-age. The data include observations of sablefish ranging from 0 to 91 years of age. The majority of unsexed fish are age 0, when sex cannot be reliably assigned. 

### NWFSC Slope Survey {#nslope-data}

The \gls{s-nslope} covered waters from 183 m to 1,280 m north of 34$^\circ$ 30$^\prime$ N latitude, which is near Point Conception, during the summers of 1999 to 2002. The survey sampled 80 fixed east-west transects, separated by 10` latitude. Five stations in each transect were selected from two depth categories: shallow (183--549 m) and deep (550--1,280 m). There were a total of 400 possible stations to sample from each year, with 302--327 successful tows on average per year. The survey was conducted from mid-August to mid-October in 1998 but was somewhat earlier in 1999 and 2000 (late-June to late-September).

`sdmTMB` was used to estimate a spatial and spatiotemporal index for the \gls{s-nslope}. The selected model used a delta model with a log-normal distribution for the catch-rate component. A logit-link was used for encounter probability and a log-link for positive catch. The response variable was catch (mt) with an offset of area (km$^2$) to account for differences in effort. Fixed effects were estimated for each year. No other covariates were modeled. Spatial and spatiotemporal variation were included in the encounter probability and the positive catch rate models. Spatial variation was approximated using 500 knots. Q-Q plot is shown in @fig-qq-nwfslope. No spatial or spatiotemporal patterns were found in the Pearson residuals. The estimated index shows a relatively flat trajectory over the survey period, except for an increase in 2000 (@fig-index-nwslope). 

Length and age data were collected by the \gls{s-nslope}. The length data were not used in this assessment and the age data were processed into bins from 0 to 50 years of age. Marginal age compositions were expanded to tow and strata levels (@tbl-nwslope-strata). Input sample sizes for the marginal age compositions were calculated using a multiplier (e.g., 2.38) by on the number of positive tows with age samples (@tbl-nwslope-samples) based on research by @stewart_bootstrapping_2014. The ages aggregated over all years are shown in @fig-data-agg-ages and by year in @fig-data-nwfsc-slope. The mean age by year with 95% confidence intervals based on current sample sizes is shown in @fig-data-nwfsc-slope-mean-age. The data include observations of sablefish ranging from 0 to 73 years of age. 

### AFSC/NWFSC West Coast Triennial Shelf Survey {#tri-data}

The \gls{s-tri} was conducted by the \gls{afsc} every three years from 1977 to 2004 [@weinberg_estimation_2002]. The survey consisted of a series of equally-spaced east-to-west transects across the continental shelf from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated. The survey design changed slightly over time but was generally conducted from mid-summer to early fall. The 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September. The surveys from 1980 through 1989 were conducted from mid-July to late September. The 1992 survey was conducted from mid-July through early October. The 1995 survey was conducted from early June through late August. The 1998 survey was conducted from early June through early August. The 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted from May to July. The sampling protocol for biological data collection varied through time, with more limited sampling in earlier years. 

Haul depths ranged from 91 to 457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower than 91 m. Due to haul performance issues and truncated sampling with respect to depth, data from 1977 were omitted from this assessment. The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the U.S. West Coast south to 36$^\circ$ 8$^\prime$ N latitude and included a depth range of 55 to 366 m. The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern range to 34$^\circ$ 50$^\prime$ N latitude (near Point Conception, CA). From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered a depth range 55 to 500 m and surveyed south to 34$^\circ$ 50$^\prime$ N latitude. In 2004, the final year of the \gls{s-tri} series, the \gls{nwfsc} \gls{fram} Division conducted the survey following similar protocols to earlier years. Due to changes in survey timing, the \gls{s-tri} data were split into early (1980--1992) and late (1995--2004) time series for this assessment. The previous assessment for sablefish accounted for these changes between the 1992 and 1995 survey years by estimating a shift in catchability (*q*). This assessment opted to split the early (1980--1992) and late (1995--2004) periods from this survey into two separate fleets to enable the modeling of changes in selectivity and separate data weighting.

`sdmTMB` was used to estimate indices of abundance for the early and late periods of the \gls{s-tri}. The selected model for both the early and late periods used a delta model with a Gamma distribution for the catch-rate component. A logit-link was used for encounter probability and a log-link for positive catch rates. The response variable was catch (mt) with an offset of area (km$^2$) to account for differences in effort. Fixed effects were estimated for each year. No other covariates were modeled. Spatial and spatiotemporal variation were included in the positive catch rate model but not the encounter probability model. Spatial variation was approximated using 500 knots. Q-Q plots for each survey period are shown in @fig-qq-tri-early and @fig-qq-tri-late. No spatial or spatiotemporal patterns were found in the Pearson residuals. The estimated index shows a relatively flat trajectory over the period from 1980 to 1989 with an increase in 1992 (@fig-index-tri-early). The late period of the \gls{s-tri} had a flat trend from 1995 to 1998 and showed an increase in 2001 and 2004 (@fig-index-tri-late).

Length and age data were collected by the \gls{s-tri}. The length data were not used in this assessment and the age data were processed into bins from 0 to 50 years of age. Marginal age compositions were expanded to tow and strata levels for each survey period based upon the change in sampling depth and latitude (@tbl-tri-early-strata and @tbl-tri-late-strata). Input sample sizes for the marginal age compositions were calculated using a multiplier (e.g., 2.38) by on the number of positive tows with age samples (@tbl-tri-early-samples and @tbl-tri-late-samples) based on research by @stewart_bootstrapping_2014. During the early \gls{s-tri}, the number of tows where age data were available was limited. The age data from 1986 were not used in the base model because they represented only one out of 372 positive tows that year (@tbl-tri-early-samples). In the late period of the \gls{s-tri}, the number of tows with age data increased relative to the early period but were still limited compared to the total bnumber of positive tows by year (except in 2004). The age data from 1998 and 2001 were excluded from the base model because they were not representative (@fig-data-tri-len-age). The location of age data by year compared to the location of tows with lengths sampled are shown in @fig-data-tri-tows.

The ages aggregated over all years are shown in @fig-data-agg-ages and by year for the early years @fig-data-tri-early and late year @fig-data-tri-late. The mean age by year with 95% confidence intervals based on current sample sizes is shown in @fig-data-tri-early-mean-age and @fig-data-tri-late-mean-age. During the early period of the \gls{s-tri}, a range of ages from 0 to 21 years were observed, with the majority of ages from 1 to 4 years of age. During the late period of the \gls{s-tri}, a range of ages from 0 to 36 years were observed, with the majority of ages from 1 to 6 years of age. 

## Environmental/Ecosystem Indicator Data {#rec-index-data}

Linear models were used to examine relationships between recruitment deviations in log-space from the 2023 assessment of sablefish and predictors from the Global Ocean Reanalysis and Simulations (GLORYS) model output. The period from 1993 to 2019 was used as training data, leaving 2020 to 2024 data as out-of-sample predictions for use in the 2025 base model. All combinations of the GLORYS predictors, excluding correlated variables from the same model,  were fit. The total number of predictors in any model was limited to three (just over 8 data points per predictor). Model selection was carried out using the `dredge` function in the `MuMIn` package in `R` [@R-base; @MuMIn-cite]. Candidate models were evaluated based on their $\Delta$AICc and number of predictors.

Five models had $\Delta$AICc values $\le$ 2.0 (@tbl-rec-index-aic). All models included cross-shelf transport during pelagic juvenile (CSTpjuv) and benthic juvenile (CSTbjuv) stages. Model 3 was identified as the best-fit because it had the fewest predictors (2). These two predictors were in all of the top five models. The best-fit model explained 37% of the variation in recruitment deviations from 1993 to 2022 (r^2^ = 0.37, @tbl-rec-index-aic, @fig-glorys-fit). The model tracked the data well, with most recruitment deviations falling within $\pm$ 1.0 standard error of the recruitment index (@fig-glorys-fit). The remaining four models included the mean temperature during spawning (Tspawn), degree days during the female preconditioning stage (DDpre), cross-shelf transport during egg stage (CSTegg), or cross-shelf transport during yolk stage (CSTyolk) as predictors. These results suggest that additional terms may help explain variance in different years, but that CSTpjuv and CSTbjuv provide a consistent basis for prediction. Including an additional factor like Tpre may increase the explained variance by \~ 10% (r^2^ = 0.47).

For all models, recruitment was negatively correlated with CSTpjuv. This suggests that processes like upwelling may be important for producing feeding conditions conducive to survival. CSTbjuv was positively correlated with recruitment, suggesting that onshore transport during the shift to benthic habitat leads to better recruitment. Both the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) analysis and the results here suggest that colder waters during the female preconditioning stage (negative correlation with DDpre, here model 2) are associated with higher recruitment (@fig-glorys-terms).

The projected recruitment index points are shown in @fig-glorys-pred and with uncertainty shown in @fig-rec-index. See Section \ref{rec-appendix} for additional details.

## Additional Data Considered {#data-not-used}

### AFSC Slope Survey

The \gls{s-aslope} operated from October to November aboard the R/V Miller Freeman. Partial survey coverage ooccurred from 1988 to 1996 and complete coverage (north of 34$^\circ$ 30$^\prime$ N latitude) took place in 1997 and from 1999 to 2001. 

The number of tows, positive tows, tows with age data, and total number of ages are shown in @tbl-afslope-samples. The \gls{s-aslope} had an unusually high rate (~ 98%) of positive tows for sablefish, particularly compared to the \gls{s-nslope} (~ 86%), which was conducted across similar years and depths. This high rate of positive tows prevented use of the delta-model given that nearly all tows were positive for sablefish. A tweedie distribution was used to estimate the index of abundance shown in @fig-data-afslope-index.

During investigations of the age data from the \gls{s-aslope}, it was determined that aged sablefish were not representative of the lengths observed (i.e., fish identified for otolith collection were not selected randomly from all fish caught; @fig-data-afslope-len-age). This issue was also identified in the most recent assessment of Dover sole {@wetzel_status_2021}. Given concerns about the data collected by the \gls{s-aslope} for sablefish and the fact that there was a comparable survey during these years, the index and associated age data from the \gls{s-aslope} were excluded from the base model.

### Fournier Transform Near Infrared Spectroscopy Age Data

Scientists at the \gls{nwfsc} and at the \gls{cap} laboratory have been working on developing age estimates using \gls{ftnirs} combined with Neural Net (NN) models. The approach takes a spectral scan of an otolith, the spectral scan information is then passed through a NN model with varying covariates to predict an age. A total of 11,722 otoliths collected by the \gls{s-wcgbt} from 2015 to 2024 have been scanned using \gls{ftnirs}. The NN model predicts age as a function of otolith weight, fish weight, depth, latitude, sex, and month. All predicted ages have a corresponding traditional age that is included in this assessment. Otoliths collected from the commercial fishery between 2018 and 2024 were also scanned, with none of these otoliths having an existing age from traditional ageing methods. The NN model was trained on age data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} between 2017 and 2022. The NN model was then used to predict ages from 2015, 2016, 2023, and 2024. The NN model predicted ages from the \gls{s-wcgbt} in 2015 and 2016 that appeared to align with traditional age estimates. However, the same model performed less well when used to predict ages from 2023 and 2024. 

The work on \gls{ftnirs} is ongoing at the \gls{nwfsc} in collaboration with other NMFS science centers and best practices are still evolving. Given the ongoing nature of this work and the challenges identified in predicting ages from 2023 and 2024, \gls{ftnirs} ages were not used in the assessment at this time. Continued research and pilot applications using \gls{ftnirs} methods for ageing, which includes an understanding of the potential benefits (e.g., increase ageing efficiency) and barriers (e.g., bias) specific to sablefish could help to achieve ongoing ageing goals given competing demands for available resources. As the methodology develops, future assessments for sablefish should evaluate NN model-predicted ages. 

### Enhanced Data Collection Program (EDCP) Discard Rates

The Enhanced Data Collection Project (EDCP) estimated a discard rate of 0.40 for select trawl vessels off Oregon in 1997. However, discard estimates from this study were not representative of the entire fleet. Thus, EDCP data were excluded from this assessment. 

## Biological Data

### Natural Mortality {#m}

The current method for developing a prior on natural mortality ($M$) for West Coast groundfish stock assessments is based on Hamel and Cope [-@hamel_development_2022]. This method combines meta-analytic approaches that relate $M$ to other life-history traits such as longevity, size, growth, and reproductive effort. This approach modifies work by Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015], which synthesized life history traits for several fish species to develop a generalized $M$ estimator. Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] recommended $M$ based on maximum age using an updated Hoenig nonlinear least squares estimator $M = 4.899A^{-0.916}_{\text{max}}$. Hamel and Cope [-@hamel_development_2022] re-evaluated the data used by Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] by fitting the one-parameter $A_{\text{max}}$ model under a log-log transformation such that the slope is forced to be -1 [@hamel_development_2022]. The point estimate and median of the prior for $M$ is:

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.5cm}

where $A_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum age. The prior is defined as a log-normal distribution with mean $ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})$ and standard error = 0.31. 

The maximum age for `r spp` was selected based on available age data from all West Coast data sources. The oldest `r spp` was captured by the commercial fishery in 2006 and estimated to be 102 yr (not accounting for potential ageing error). Examining all aged fish from commercial and survey data, a maximum age of 75 yr was selected for both sexes. Across all data sources, there were limited estimates older than 75 yr. There is a higher frequency of older males compared to females observed in the data, though females grow to larger sizes and generally have higher fishery selectivity that may bias the sex-ratio of older individuals. Using a maximum age of 75 yr, the median of the prior was 0.72 yr$^{-1}$ with a standard error of 0.31.

### Sex Ratio {#sex-ratio}

The sex ratio observed showed some patterns by depth, with an approximate 50:50 ratio from 55 to 400 m. There were slightly more males from 500 to 1,100 m and a higher proportion females at the deepest depths (@fig-sex-ratio-wcgbt). The sex ratio varied by age in the \gls{s-wcgbt} data, with a 50:50 ratio at younger ages and a higher ratio of males at age 10+ yr (@fig-wcgbt-age-sex-ratio). A reduction in the number of females compared to males for these older ages could be due to greater fishing pressure for females, which are generally larger-at-age. It would also be due to sex-specific differences in natural mortality. This assessment assumed the same $M$ for both sexes but also explored sex-specific estimates.

### Growth {#growth}

Range-wide investigations of `r spp` suggest that growth varies across the northeastern Pacific, with a generally increasing cline in length-at-age with latitude [@mcdevitt1987sablefish; @echave2012fishbullinterdecadal; @gertseva2017icesjmsspatial; @kapur_oceanographic_2020]. A break point in growth has been identified at ~ $50^\circ$ N latitude (at the northern end of Vancouver Island, Canada), where female asymptotic length is > 70 cm to the north and < 66 cm to the south [@kapur_oceanographic_2020]. A second break point was identified at 36$^\circ$ N latitude (approximately Monterey, California), where asymptotic length to the south is 60 cm for females and 55 cm for males [@kapur_oceanographic_2020]. 

Female `r spp` generally grow to larger sizes than males. The size at age for the oldest `r spp` is highly variable, leading to considerable uncertainty in maximum size. For example, the 95th quantile of all lengths from the \gls{s-wcgbt} is from 55 to 77 cm for females and from 51 to 67 cm for males. As found by @kapur_oceanographic_2020, splitting data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} north and south of 36$^\circ$ N latitude results in smaller length-at-age to the south (@fig-external-growth). Examining von Bertanlaffy growth parameters by latitude support a shift in growth rates north and south of 38$^\circ$ N latitude (@fig-external-growth-lat).

The review of the 2019 assessment noted that a time-invariant growth curve resulted in periods of misfit to conditional-age-at-length data from the \gls{s-wcgbt}, suggesting that growth may vary by year and age. The review panel recommended that future assessments explore an empirical weight-at-age approach to account for time-varying growth. This assessment uses an empirical weight-at-age approach in the base model. 

### Weight-at-Age {#watage}

A matrix of empirically derived weight-at-age data is used in the current assessment model to translate numbers-at-age to biomass-at-age in each year. Annual weight-at-age data was modeled from biological samples from the \gls{s-wcgbt} between 2003 and 2024. Weight-at-age from fishery samples were excluded because weight is not reported for samples in California and only available for very limited samples in Washington. Samples are shown by year, sex, and age in @tbl-watage-samples, with totals in the age 25+ column reflecting the total for 25 yr and older fish.

Following a similar approach used for Pacific hake, a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a log-normal distribution has been used to model weight-at-age data by sex and area (e.g., north and south of 36$^\circ$ N latitude). Weight was modeled as a smoothed effect of age with random effects for cohort and year and a fixed effect for sex. Weights from fish ages 30 yr and older were pooled, thus the oldest fish are assumed to have the same weight-at-age. The 30 yr plus group was based on weight-at-age data and the growth curve. Estimated parameters from this model were weighted by collection area and used to predict sex-specific weight-at-age for 0 to 30 yr fish from 2003 to 2019 and 2021 to 2024. The year-, sex-, and age-specific means were used as inputs for the assessment model (@fig-data-watage, @fig-weight-at-age-female, and @fig-weight-at-age-male). 

The biomass at the start of a given year is based on weight-at-age from the same mid-year when samples were collected by the \gls{s-wcgbt}. A similar approach was used by the Pacific hake assessment, given that samples at the beginning of the year are limited. Prior to 2003, weight-at-age inputs are assumed to be equal to the mean of all available years for each respective age (2003 to 2019 and 2021 to 2024). Sex-specific weight-at-age for 2020 was assumed to be equal to the mean of 2019 and 2021. Predicted weight-at-age was based on age-specific means from the most recent five years in the data (2020 to 2024).

The use of empirical weight-at-age data is a convenient method to capture variability in the weight-at-length relationship both within and among years. It also accounts for variability in length-at-age data without requiring parametric models to represent growth. 

### Maturity and Fecundity {#mat-fecund}

New maturity reads and analyses were available for this assessment. A total of `r dim(maturity_data)[1]` sablefish maturity samples were collected by the \gls{s-wcgbt} in 2010, 2015, 2018, 2021, and 2022 (@tbl-maturity-samples). The maturity samples were evaluated for functional maturity, which classifies fish with developing oocytes as mature or immature. Estimates of maturity-at-age or maturity-at-length were evaluated north and south of 36$^\circ$ N latitude. Of the samples processed, sablefish were identified to be mature as early as age `r min(maturity_data[which(maturity_data$Area == "North" & maturity_data$functional_maturity == 1), "age"])` in the north and `r min(maturity_data[which(maturity_data$Area == "South" & maturity_data$functional_maturity == 1), "age"])` in the south. Generally, sablefish tend to mature at younger ages in the north compared to the south (@fig-maturity-data). 

Following similar approaches in recent Pacific hake assessments, maturity was estimated using spatial models and age or length as the predictor variable. A total of 10 spatial and spatiotemporal models were considered but data limitations required that only models with spatial effects or spatially varying coefficients (e.g., no fixed year effects of spatiotemporal fields) were considered. Day of year was omitted from the models and results given little support for such an effect. A spatial field and spatially varying effect of length (spatial varying ~ length scaled or spatial varying ~ age scaled ), which are analogous to a spatial intercept and spatial slope, were included. These components allow maturation rates to vary spatially but assume relatively constant rates through time. 

Maturity as a function of age shows a strong spatial gradient, with lower age-at-50% ($a_{50}$) estimates in the north compared to the south. Maturity as a function of length shows a weaker spatial gradient, with more patchiness (e.g., several estimates of above average length-at-50% ($l_{50}$) off southern California). For each of the models, estimates of $a_{50}$ and $a_{50}$ were generated in two ways: coastwide and spatially split north and south of 36$^\circ$ N latitude. A coastwide maturity curve was estimated by weighting the spatially split curves by biomass estimates from the \gls{s-wcgbt}. The assessment uses the biomass weighted maturity curve (spatial, @fig-maturity-ogive).

Available data suggest that `r spp` are determinate spawners (i.e., total oocytes at the beginning of the spawning season is equivalent to total annual spawning output) that spawn three to four times per year [@hunter1989; @macewicz1994]. The total number of oocytes at the beginning of the spawning season appears to be linearly proportional to weight [@hunter1989], suggesting that spawning output for a mature female is also proportional to weight. This assumption has been used in previous `r spp` stock assessments and is retained here in the absence of new information. Data on skipped spawning are unavailable, as are data on environmental effects or other factors that could cause fecundity to vary non-linearly with weight.

The product of the maturity-at-age and the fecundity-at-age (e.g., equal to weight) is show in @fig-fecundity-maturity.

### Ageing Precision and Bias

Observed `r spp` ages are derived from visually counting rings on otoliths using break-and-burn methods. These counts can be large because `r spp` are long-lived and the repeatability of individual age estimates is imperfect, especially for older fish. Age-reading staff have indicated that `r spp` can be difficult to age. The observed age can differ, sometimes substantially, from the true age of a fish (i.e., "reading error"). Ageing error can be decomposed into the difference between true age and average-read age (bias) and variability around that average read age (precision). 

The majority of aged `r spp` used in the assessment were aged by the \gls{cap}. Within-lab ageing error was estimated for \gls{cap}. Break-and-burn double reads of more than 12,000 otoliths were provided by the \gls{cap} lab (unpublished data). An ageing error estimate was made based on these double reads using a computational tool specifically developed for estimating ageing error [@punt_quantifying_2008] and using release 2.1.0. of the R package \href{https://pfmc-assessments.github.io/AgeingError/index.html}{AgeingError} for input and output diagnostics. 

Ageing error analyses were run exploring ageing bias and linear or curve-linear error with age. One reader was selected as unbiased and age estimates from all other readers where grouped into a second reader vector. The linear model with no bias in age estimation was selected as the final model (@fig-ageing-error). A comparison of age reads are shown in @fig-age-reader.
