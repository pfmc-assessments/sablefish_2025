## Data

A description of each data source is provided below (Figure XX).

### Fishery-dependent data

#### Landings

Landings for `r spp` were composed various historical landings reconstructions, historical foreign fishery data, data extracted from Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN, extracted April, 21, 2025), and at-sea bycatch estimates (provided by Vanessa Tuttle, NWFSC). The landings used in this assessment are shown in Figure XX and Table XX. 

For the state of California, commercial landings between 1900 and 1931 were calculated following the approach used in the 2011 and 2019 assessments for `r spp` where 1916 to 1931 landings estimates were available from published California Department of Fish and Game Bulletins back, 1908 to 1916 were based on Fisheries statistics of the U.S., published by the U.S. Fish Commission, and 1900 to 1907 landings were were extrapolated linearly to zero in 1900. For the period 1931-1968 relied on estimates from the recent reconstruction efforts by Southwest Fisheries Science Center and California Department of Fish and Game scientists [@ralston_documentation_2010]. This effort utilized newly available spatial information regarding groundfish landings back to 1931. This method is probably quite reliable for sablefish, since it was identified as a separate market category. Landings between 1969 to 1977 were based on California fish tickets with a ratio estimator approach and between 1978 to 1980 were pulled from CALCOM database [@pearson_reliability_2008]. Prior to 1969, gear type associated with landings were not available and were allocated between trawl and hook-and-line gear based upon the proportions starting in 1969 with no landings assumed to be based on pot gear since the landings with pot gear were negligible (e.g., less than 0.5 mt in 1969 and 1970) until 1971. The most recent historical landings from 1981 to 2024 were extracted from PacFIN.

Oregon landings reconstructions begins in 1927 through 1986 [@karnowski_historical_2014]. -@low_sablefish_1976 provided total landings from 1915-1926. Prior to 1915 no statistics were available, so a linear extrapolation from the 10 mt estimate for 1915 to 0 mt in 1981 was applied. Again for Oregon the periods with substantial uncertainty in landings had trivial landings levels. Oregon landings from 1987 to 2024 were extracted from PacFIN. 

Washington completed a historical landings reconstruction for this 2019 assessment of `r spp` which was used in this assessment. These landings represent the best available information. The following information sources were included in the reconstruction: 1890 to 1908 from U.S. Fish Commission bulletin, 1915 to 1952 from PMFC bulletin 3, appendix (page 130, using a conversion factor of 1.75 for dressed fish), 1953 to 1969 from the Washington Statistical bulletin, and 1970 to 1980 from Washington fish ticket database. Landings area assignments were based on Seattle market reports and Washington Statistical bulletins. Gear type was based on PMFC bulletin 3 (page 44, Table 2) and Washington Statistical bulletins. Landings between 1981 to 1990 were based upon Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) internal estimates due to large descrepancies between PacFIN and WDFW estimates. In 1981 and 1982 the estimates within PacFIN were much higher than those in WDFW database (e.g., PacFIN estimates were 636 and 1,777 mt greater than WDFW estimates), but estimates in WDFW database were greater than PacFIN between 1983 to 1990 (e.g., differences ranging between 21 mt to 171 mt by year). These landings estimates for `r spp` should be investigated to reconcile differences to improve future assessments of `r spp`. Washington landings between 1991 to 2024 were extracted from PacFIN.

This assessment also included data on bycatch of `r spp` by the Pacific hake At-Sea fishery since 1978. These data were not included in the 2019 assessment of `r spp` but landings between 1990 to 2022 were included in the most recent update assessment in 2023. Across most years the bycatch of `r spp` in the Pacific hake at-Sea fishery is relatively low, particularly compared to the landings data from other groundfish sectors contained in PacFIN. However, there have been select years where the bycatch of `r spp` in this fishery has been higher than average. Bycatch was high between 1979 and 1982 ranging between 103 mt to 359 mt. In recent years, high bycatch in the Pacific hake at-sea fishery is likely driven by strong recruitment events with 153 mt and 117 mt of bycatch in 2017 and 2018, respectively, and 306 mt and 161 mt in 2022 and 2023. 

Foreign catches are included in the landings estimates for commercial fleets and were very large in the late 1970s. This assessment assumed the same foreign landings reconstruction used in previous `r spp` asssessments based on the records in the historical annotated landings (HAL) database [@van_houten_lynde_historical_1986].

#### Discards

Data on discards of `r spp` are available from multiple sources. 

A trawl discard study conducted in 1985 to 1987, referred to as the Pikitch study, organized by Ellen Pikitch resulted in discard rates and length observations for various groundfish species including `rs spp`  [@pikitch_evaluation_1988]. The northern and southern boundaries of the study were $48^\circ 42^\prime$ N. latitude and $48^\circ 42^\prime$ N. latitude respectively, which is primarily within the Columbia INPFC area, falling within Oregon/Washington waters [@pikitch_evaluation_1988; @rogers_numerical_1992]. Participation in the study was voluntary and included vessels using bottom, midwater, and shrimp trawl gears. Observers on commercial vessels collected the data, estimated the total weight of the catch by tow, and recorded the weight of species retained and discarded in the sample. Results of the Pikitch discard study were processed and provided by John Wallace (personal communication, Northwest Fishery Science Center, NWFSC, NOAA) in the form of ratios of discard weight to retained weight of `r spp` and sex-specific length frequencies. The observed discard length observations by year and sex for `r spp` from the Pikitch study were limited. In order to reduce the noise in these data sex-specific observations were combined based on the assumption that discarding of small fish was not sex-specific (there was no indication of this in the data).

The final data for discard rates, meand body weight of discarded fish, and length observations is from the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP). This program is part of the NWFSC and has been recording discard observations starting in 2002. Since 2011, when the IFQ program was implemented, observer coverage rates increased to nearly 100 percent for all the limited entry trawl vessels in the program and discard rates declined compared to pre-2011 rates. Discard rates were obtained for both the IFQ catch-share (observed and electronic monitored vessels) and the non-catch share sector for `r spp`. A single discard rate was calculated by weighting discard rates based on the commercial discards by each sector and gear type based on estimates from the Groundfish Expanded Multi-year Mortality (GEMM) report. Coefficient of variations were calculated for the non-catch shares sector and pre-catch share years by bootstrapping vessels within ports because the observer program randomly chooses vessels within ports to be observed. Post trawl rationalization, all catch-share vessels have 100 percent observer coverage and discarding is assumed to be known.

The discard rates across all data sources by fleet based on gear type are shown in Table XX and Figures XX - XX. The mean weights of discarded `r spp` from WCGCOP data are shown in Figures XX and XX. The discard length observations from the Pikitch study and WCGOP are shown in Figures XX and XX.

#### Composition Data




### Fishery-Independent Data

Data from four research surveys have been used in this assessment to provide fishery-independent information about the abundance, distribution, and biological characteristics
of `r spp`. The longest time series of fishery-independent data arises from the NWFSC
West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl (WCGBT) survey which began in 2003. This survey
samples the shelf and slope off the U.S. West Coast covering depths from 30--700 fathoms (55--1,280 meters) on an annual basis (excluding 2020 due to COVID-19). This assessment also
used data from three additional fishery-independent surveys: NWFSC Slope survey, Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) Slope survey, and the AFSC/NWFSC West Coast Triennial Shelf survey (Triennial Survey). 


The indices from each fishery-independent source were standardized for comparison. Each
index of abundance was re-scaled relative its mean index value (i.e., each index centered
around 1.0) shown in Figure XX.

#### NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey

The WCGBT survey is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth
of 55 - 1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011]. This design generally uses four industry-chartered
vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and
divided into two ‘passes’ of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass
between late May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel
differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small
number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread
from the U.S./Mexico to the U.S./Canada borders.

`r Spp` are observed across the full range of depths (Figure XX) and latitudes (Figure XX) sampled by the
WCGBT survey. A coastwide relative index of abundance was estimated for sablefish using the Species
Distribution Modeling platform written in Template Model Builder (TMB) (sdmTMB; Anderson et al. [-@Anderson:2022:SRP]). A delta model with a gamma error distribution was selected over the lognormal distribution based on the quantile-quantile plots (Figure XX). This was the same error distribution selected by the 2019 benchmark and 2023 update assessments. The relative index of abundance for `r spp` decreased to the lowest levels between 2008 and 2010, begun to slowly increase between 2011 and 2019, and then sharply increased in 2021 to 2022 and remained high in 2023 and 2024 (Figure XX).

Length and age samples collected annually during the WCGBT survey were processed using 2 cm length bins
between 18 cm and 90 cm and age bins between 0 and 50 years. The length compositions were expanded to
the tow level and strata level. The age data were included as conditional-age-at-length data to better inform the internal estimation of growth than can be done using marginal age data. Input sample size for the length composition were based on the number of positive tows and a multiplier. lInput sample sizes for the conditional-age-at-length data were the annual number of fish sampled for both age and length.

The 2021 and 2022 length compositions for fish less than 30 cm indicate potentially multiple above average
recruitments entering the population (Figure XX). The age data indicate above average
observations of fish from the 2023, 2021, and 2020 cohorts (Figure XX). Across all years, age-0 fish were observed more frequently during the second pass of the survey compared to the first pass, with age-0 fish generally measuring less than 30 cm (Figure XX). The size of age-1 fish generally ranged between 30 cm and 45 cm, with sizes increasing from pass 1 to pass 2. The distribution of age-1 fish size observed in 2021 and 2022 was more variable compared to most other years. Additionally, the distribution of sizes in age-1 fish varied between 2021 and 2022, with age-1 fish being slightly smaller by pass in 2022 compared to 2021.

#### NWFSC Slope Survey

The NWFSC Slope Survey covered waters throughout the summer from 183 m to 1,280
m north of 34\^\circ$ 30$^\prime$ N. latitude, which is near Point Conception, from 1999 and 2002. The
survey sampled 80 fixed east - west transects of latitude, separated by 10 minutes of latitude.
Five stations in each transect were selected from two depth categories: shallow strata (184
- 549 m) and deep strata (550 - 1,280 m). There were a total of 400 possible stations to
sample from each year, with 302 - 327 successful tows on average per year. The survey was
conducted from mid-August to mid-October in 1998 but was somewhat earlier in 1999 and
2000 (late-June to late- September).


#### AFSC Slope Survey

The AFSC Slope survey operated during the months of October to November aboard the
R/V Miller Freeman. Partial survey coverage of the U.S. west coast occurred during the years
1988 - 1996 and complete coverage (north of 34$^\circ$ 30$^\prime$ N. latitude) during the years 1997 and
1999-2001. Typically, only these four years that are seen as complete surveys are included in
groundfish stock assessments.


#### AFSC/NWFSC West Coast Triennial Shelf Survey

The Triennial survey was first conducted by the AFSC in 1977, and the survey continued
until 2004 [@weinberg_estimation_2002]. Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced east-to-west
transects across the continental shelf from which searches for tows in a specific depth range
were initiated. The survey design changed slightly over time. In general, all of the surveys
were conducted in the mid-summer through early fall. The 1977 survey was conducted from
early July through late September. The surveys from 1980 through 1989 were conducted
from mid-July to late September. The 1992 survey was conducted from mid-July through
early October. The 1995 survey was conducted from early June through late August. The
1998 survey was conducted from early June through early August. Finally, the 2001 and
2004 surveys were conducted from May to July.

Haul depths ranged from 91 - 457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower than 91
m. Due to haul performance issues and truncated sampling with respect to depth, the data
from 1977 were omitted from this analysis. The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the
U.S. west coast south to 36.8$^\circ$ N. latitude and a depth range of 55 - 366 m. The surveys in
1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern range to 34$^\circ$ 50$^\prime$ N.
latitude (near Point Conception). From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth
range 55 - 500 m and surveyed south to 34$^\circ$ 50$^\prime$ N. latitude. In 2004, the final year of the
Triennial Survey series, the NWFSC Fishery Resource and Monitoring division (FRAM)
conducted the survey following similar protocols to earlier years. Due to changes in survey
timing, the Triennial survey data have been split into independent early (1980 - 1992) and
late (1995 - 2004) survey time series. The split of the time series was done in the base model
via a shift in catchability (Q) between the 1992 and 1995 survey years.

### Additional Data Considered

### Biological Data

#### Natural Mortality


The current method for developing a prior on natural mortality for West Coast groundfish stock assessments is based on Hamel and Cope [-@hamel_development_2022], a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the $M$ rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on $M$. This approach modifies work done by Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] who estimated $M$ and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an $M$ estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending $M$ estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least squares estimator $M = 4.899A^{-0.916}_{\text{max}}$. Hamel and Cioe [-@hamel_development_2022] re-evaluated the data used by Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] by fitting the one-parameter $A_{\text{max}}$ model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space [@hamel_development_2022]), the point estimate and median of the prior for $M$ is:

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.5cm}

where $A_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum age. The prior is defined as a lognormal distribution with mean $ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})$ and standard error = 0.31.  

The maximum age for `r spp` was selected based on available age data from all West Coast data sources. The oldest aged `r spp` was 102 years, captured by the commercial fishery in 2006, not accounting for potential ageing error. Examining all aged fish, a maximum age of 75 was selected. Across all data sources there were limited observation greater than 75 years of age. There are a higher frequency of older males compared to females observed in the data, however, females grow to larger sizes and generally have higher fishery selectivity which may bias the sex-ratio of older individuals. Using a maximum age of , the median of the prior was 0.72 yr$^{-1}$ with a standard error of 0.31.

#### Growth/Weight-at-Age


#### Maturity and Fecundity

#### Ageing Precision and Bias

Uncertainty surrounding the age-reading error process for `r spp` was incorporated by estimating ageing error by age. Age composition data used in the model were from break-and-burn otolith reads.  

The large majority of aged `r spp` used in the assessment were aged by the Cooperative Ageing Project (CAP).  Within-lab ageing error was estimated for CAP. Break-and-burn double reads of more than 12,000 otoliths were provided by the CAP lab (unpublished data).  An ageing error estimate was made based on these double reads using a computational tool specifically developed for estimating ageing error [@punt_quantifying_2008] and using release 2.02. of the R package \href{https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/nwfscAgeingError}{AgeingError} for input and output diagnostics. A linear standard error was estimated by age where there is more variability in the age of older fish (Figure XX). Sensitivities to alternative ageing error estimates (curvilinear relationship with age) were conducted during model development and the model was relatively insensitive to alternative ageing error assumptions.
