## Fishery-Dependent data

### Landings

Landings for `r spp` were composed various historical landings reconstructions, historical foreign fishery catch data, landings data extracted from Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN, extracted February, 25, 2025),  Pacific hake at-sea fishery catch estimates (provided by Vanessa Tuttle, NWFSC), and landings data extracted from Recreational Fisheries Information Network (RecFIN, extracted February, 28, 2025). The landings used in this assessment are shown in @fig-landings and @tbl-landings. 

The model includes six fishery fleets: 1) trawl, 2) hook-and-line, 3) pot landings, 4) trawl discards, 5) hook-and-line discards, and 6) pot discards. The trawl fleet includes mortality from the domestic historical (pre-1981 in California and Washington, pre-1987 in Oregon) and current landings available in PacFIN, estimated foreign trawl catch, and  Pacific hake at-sea fishery total mortality estimates.  The hook-and-line fleet includes mortality from the domestic historical (pre-1981 in California and Washington, pre-1987 in Oregon) and current landings available in PacFIN, estimated foreign hook-and-line total mortality, and recreational fisheries total mortality estimates. The pot fleet includes mortality from the domestic historical (pre-1981 in California and Washington, pre-1987 in Oregon) and current landings available in PacFIN and estimated foreign pot catch. The discard fleets estimated discards for the domestic historical and current landings using available information on discard rates with gear-specific discard mortality rates.

For the state of California, commercial landings between 1900 and 1931 were calculated following the approach used in the 2011 and 2019 assessments for `r spp` where 1916 to 1931 landings estimates were available from published California Department of Fish and Game Bulletins back, 1908 to 1916 were based on Fisheries statistics of the U.S., published by the U.S. Fish Commission, and 1900 to 1907 landings were were extrapolated linearly to zero in 1900. For the period 1931-1968 relied on estimates from the recent reconstruction efforts by Southwest Fisheries Science Center and California Department of Fish and Game scientists [@ralston_documentation_2010]. This effort utilized newly available spatial information regarding groundfish landings back to 1931. This method is probably quite reliable for `r spp`, since it was identified as a separate market category. Landings between 1969 to 1977 were based on California fish tickets with a ratio estimator approach and between 1978 to 1980 were pulled from CALCOM database. Prior to 1969, gear type associated with landings were not available and were allocated between trawl and hook-and-line gear based upon the proportions starting in 1969 with no landings assumed to be based on pot gear since the landings with pot gear were negligible (e.g., less than 0.5 mt in 1969 and 1970) until 1971. The most recent historical landings from 1981 to 2024 were extracted from PacFIN. 

Oregon landings reconstructions begins in 1927 through 1986 [@karnowski_historical_2014]. -@low_sablefish_1976 provided total landings from 1915-1926. Prior to 1915 no statistics were available, so a linear extrapolation from the 10 mt estimate for 1915 to 0 mt in 1891 was applied. Oregon landings from 1987 to 2024 were extracted from PacFIN. 

Washington completed a historical landings reconstruction for this 2019 assessment of `r spp` which was used in this assessment. These landings represent the best available information. The following information sources were included in the reconstruction: 1890 to 1908 from U.S. Fish Commission bulletin, 1915 to 1952 from PMFC bulletin 3, appendix (page 130, using a conversion factor of 1.75 for dressed fish), 1953 to 1969 from the Washington Statistical bulletin, and 1970 to 1980 from Washington fish ticket database. Landings area assignments were based on Seattle market reports and Washington Statistical bulletins. Gear type was based on PMFC bulletin 3 (page 44, Table 2) and Washington Statistical bulletins. Washington landings between 1981 to 2024 were extracted from PacFIN.

This assessment also included data on catch of `r spp` by the Pacific hake at-sea fishery since 1978. These data were not included in the 2019 assessment of `r spp` but landings between 1990 to 2022 were included in the most recent update assessment in 2023. This assessment extends the at-sea catches to the first year of available catch data, 1978. Across most years the catch of `r spp` in the Pacific hake at-sea fishery is relatively low, particularly compared to the landings data from other groundfish sectors contained in PacFIN. However, there have been select years where the catch of `r spp` in this fishery has been higher than average. Catch was high between 1979 and 1982 ranging between 103 mt to 359 mt. In recent years, high catch in the Pacific hake at-sea fishery is likely driven by strong recruitment events with 153 mt and 117 mt of bycatch in 2017 and 2018, respectively, and 306 mt and 161 mt in 2022 and 2023. The estimates provided from the \gls{ashop} included both discarded and retained catch of `r spp` and were included in assessment in a separate trawl catch fleet. 

Foreign catches are included in gear specific fleets. The foreign catch reconstructions were based on the records in the historical annotated landings (HAL) database [@lynde_historical_1986]. The catch by foreign vessels were very large in the late 1970s, relative to domestic fleets at that time. Previous assessments included the foreign catches in the corresponding landings gear fleet which resulted additional mortality being estimated (e.g., treated as if the estimates were landings not catches that accounted for total mortality). Since @lynde_historical_1986 indicates that the values are catches that account for both estimates of landings and discarding, these catches were separated into separate catch fleets for this assessment.    

Recreational fishery landings were included in this assessment and added to the hook-and-line landings fleet in the model. Recreational landings of `r spp` were low historically with the average mortality being less than 3 mt per year between 2001-2022, but have been sharply increased in recent years. In 2023, recreational mortality coastwide peaked at 34 mt and decreased in 2024 to 29 mt. 

This assessment also included discard fleets for each gear type. The estimates for discard mortality were based on information about historical, when available, and current discarding practices by fleet.  Discard mortality was estimated for the domestic historical and current landings only using \gls{pfmc} adopted gear-specific discard mortality rates of 20 percent for fixed gear and 50 percent for trawl gear. Previous assessments of sablefish have assumed these same discard mortality rates. The discard fleet mortality was calculated for the domestic commercial landings only (e.g., historical commercial reconstructions and landings in PacFIN). 

The calculated discard mortality for each gear between 2002 -- 2023 used \gls{wcgop} gear-specific annual discard rates and discard mortality rates multiplied by the corresponding domestic landings in PacFIN. The discard mortality prior to 2002 for hook-and-line and pot gear was calculated using the average gear-specific discard rate between 2002-2010 and discard mortality rate multiplied by the domestic year-specific landings from 1890-2001 (e.g., landings in PacFIN and the historical catch reconstructions).  The discard mortality for trawl gear prior to 2002 was based upon the average of discard rates observed in the Pikitch data for 1985-1987 and discard mortality rate multiplied by the domestic year-specific landings from 1890-2001.  The discard mortality in 2024 was calculated by using the gear-specific discard rate for 2023. No discard mortality was assumed between 1942-1946 during World War II.  The estimation of the gear-specific annual discard rates is described below. 

A comparison between the total mortality from this assessment and the estimated total mortality from the previous assessment is shown in @fig-landings-comparison. 

### Discards

Data on discards of `r spp` are available from multiple sources. A trawl discard study conducted in 1985 to 1987, referred to as the "Pikitch study", organized by Ellen Pikitch resulted in discard rates and length observations for various groundfish species including `r spp`  [@pikitch_evaluation_1988]. The northern and southern boundaries of the study were $48^\circ 42^\prime$ N. latitude and $48^\circ 42^\prime$ N. latitude respectively, which is primarily within the Columbia INPFC area, falling within Oregon/Washington waters [@pikitch_evaluation_1988; @rogers_numerical_1992]. Participation in the study was voluntary and included vessels using bottom, midwater, and shrimp trawl gears. Observers on commercial vessels collected the data, estimated the total weight of the catch by tow, and recorded the weight of species retained and discarded in the sample. Results of the Pikitch discard study were processed and provided by John Wallace (personal communication, Northwest Fishery Science Center, NOAA) in the form of ratios of discard weight to retained weight of `r spp`. 

The second source for discard data is from \gls{wcgop}. This program is part of the NWFSC and has been recording discard observations starting in 2002. Since 2011, when the IFQ program was implemented, observer coverage rates increased to nearly 100 percent for all the limited entry trawl vessels in the program and discard rates declined compared to pre-2011 rates. Discard rates were obtained for both the IFQ catch-share (observed and electronic monitored vessels) and the non-catch share sector for `r spp`. A single discard rate was calculated by weighting discard rates based on the commercial discards by each sector and gear type based on estimates from the \gls{gemm} report. Coefficient of variations were calculated for the non-catch shares sector and pre-catch share years by bootstrapping vessels within ports because the observer program randomly chooses vessels within ports to be observed. Post trawl rationalization, all catch-share vessels have 100 percent observer coverage and discarding is assumed to be known. The discard rates from both data sources by fleet based on gear type are shown in @tbl-discard-rates-twl -- @tbl-discard-rates-pot.  

\gls{wcgop} collects biological data for observed discards from the commercial fishery.  For sablefish, only length data were available from \gls{wcgop}. However, this assessment is using a empirical weight-at-age approach to account for time-varying changes in growth requiring all composition data to be age-based  (see section \ref{watage} for details). The observed discard length data were converted to an estimated age based on a year and area (north or south of 36$^\circ$ N. latitude) length-age key. The `FSA` package in R was used to convert lengths to ages. The package calculates probabilities of a fish being an age given length.  Data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} was used to inform the estimated age-length probabilities since annual data were available that included spatial information (@fig-alk). The estimated ages were then used to inform the estimation of selectivity for each of the gear-specific discard fleets. The estimated ages by gear where then expanded to the tow level and aggregated annually for each gear type.  

The aggregated estimated discard ages by gear type are shown in @fig-data-agg-ages. Discard ages by gear and year are shown in @fig-discard-ages-trawl -- @fig-discard-ages-pot. Generally, the trawl discards younger fish with both hook-and-line and pot gear discarding a wider range of ages compared to trawl.  

### Composition Data

Data for all states were extracted from PacFIN's Biological Data System (BDS). Broadly, the weighting of commercial biological samples was conducted via the following method using the R package \href{https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/pacfintools}{\texttt{pacfintool}} developed and managed by scientists at the \gls{nwfsc}. The package queries, filters, and expands fishery biological data based on the following steps:

\begin{enumerate} 
\item Expand the sample weight of lengths or ages from the state recorded sub-sample, consisting of one or more baskets of fish, to the estimated total landings in that market category (or trip for ungraded samples). When sample weights were unavailable, as is always the case for fish landed in Washington, gender-specific weight-length relationships were used to approximate the weight of the sample. 
\item Sum the trip-expanded values within model-based gear fleets and state combinations. Data sampled from larger landings thus account for more weight in the sum to better reflect the total landings.
\item Expand the values to gear-specific landings, ensuring that data by state are expanded based upon the total landings within that state.
\item Calculate input sample sizes based upon the number of trips and samples.
\end{enumerate}

The input sample sizes for each fleet in the model were calculated via the Stewart method (Ian Stewart, personal communication):

\begin{centering}

Input N = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input N = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.50cm}

Commercial length and age data were queried from PacFIN. Commercial length data are available in PacFIN starting in 1974 and 1983 for age data.  This assessment incorporated only commercial age data to estimate the age distribution of removal by gear type.  Initial investigation to the available age data identified a number of age samples that were not incorporated in the 2019 assessment.  Comparisons between the number of age samples by year for trawl and fixed gear (e.g., hook-and-line and pot combined based on the previous assessment) are shown in @tbl-twl-age-samples-comp -- @tbl-fixed-age-samples-comp. 

The total number of age samples, trips samples, and the calculated input sample size by year and gear type are shown in @tbl-twl-age-samples, @tbl-hkl-age-samples, and @tbl-pot-age-samples.  Across all years, 28 percent, 50 percent, and 22 percent of all age data arise from California, Oregon, and Washington, respectively. By gear, 57 percent of available age data are from the trawl fleet, 32 percent from hook-and-line, and 11 percent from pot. The trawl fleet catches younger fish compared to hook-and-line and pot (@fig-data-agg-ages). The age data from retained landing by hook-and-line and pot gear are similar with each fleet having a larger proportion of female fish compared to male fish. The age data by year from the trawl fleet are shown in @fig-data-trawl-1 -- @fig-data-trawl-2, hook-and-line in @fig-data-hkl-1 -- @fig-data-hkl-2, and pot in 
@fig-data-pot-1 -- @fig-data-pot-2.

## Fishery-Independent Data

Data from four research surveys have been used in this assessment to provide fishery-independent information about the abundance, distribution, and biological characteristics
of `r spp`. The longest time series of fishery-independent data arises from the NWFSC
West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl (WCGBT) survey which began in 2003. This survey
samples the shelf and slope off the U.S. West Coast covering depths from 30--700 fathoms (55--1,280 meters) on an annual basis (excluding 2020 due to COVID-19). This assessment also
used data from three additional fishery-independent surveys: NWFSC Slope survey, Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) Slope survey, and the AFSC/NWFSC West Coast Triennial Shelf survey (Triennial Survey). 

The indices from each fishery-independent source were standardized for comparison. Each
index of abundance was re-scaled relative its mean index value (i.e., each index centered
around 1.0) shown in @fig-index-stand.

### NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey

The \gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth
of 55 - 1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011]. This design generally uses four industry-chartered
vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and
divided into two ‘passes’ of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass
between late May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel
differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small
number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread
from the U.S./Mexico to the U.S./Canada borders.

`r Spp` are observed across the full range of latitudes (@fig-positive-lat-wcgbt) and depths (@fig-positive-depth-wcgbt) sampled by the \gls{s-wcgbt}. The sex ratio of positive tows is roughly 50-50 between females and males between 55 - 400 m in depth, greater than 50 percent male between 400 -1,100 m, and greater than 50 percent female at the deepest depths sampled (@fig-sex-ratio-wcgbt). 

A coastwide relative index of abundance was estimated for `r spp` using the Species
Distribution Modeling platform written in Template Model Builder (TMB) (sdmTMB; Anderson et al. [-@Anderson:2022:SRP]). A delta model with a gamma error distribution was selected over the lognormal distribution based on the quantile-quantile plots (@fig-qq-wcgbt). This was the same error distribution selected by the 2019 benchmark and 2023 update assessments. The relative index of abundance for `r spp` decreased to the lowest levels between 2008 and 2010, begun to slowly increase between 2011 and 2019, and then sharply increased in 2021 to 2022 and remained high in 2023 and 2024 (@fig-index-wcgbt). The estimated proportion of biomass observed by the \gls{s-wcgbt} north and south of 36$^\circ$ North latitude over the last five years of the survey are shown in @tbl-prop-area.

Length and age samples collected annually during the \gls{s-wcgbt} were processed using 2 cm length bins
between 18 cm and 90 cm and age bins between 0 and 50 years. The length and marginal age compositions were expanded to
the tow level and strata level (@tbl-wcgbt-strata). The age data were included as conditional-age-at-length data to better inform the internal estimation of growth than can be done using marginal age data. Input sample size for the length marginal age composition were based on the number of positive tows and a multiplier (@tbl-wcgbt-samples). Input sample sizes for the conditional-age-at-length data were the annual number of fish sampled for both age and length.

The 2021 and 2022 length compositions for fish less than 30 cm indicate potentially multiple above average
recruitments entering the population (Figure XX). The age data indicate above average
observations of fish from the 2023, 2021, and 2020 cohorts (Figure XX). Across all years, age-0 fish were observed more frequently during the second pass of the survey compared to the first pass, with age-0 fish generally measuring less than 30 cm (Figure XX). The size of age-1 fish generally ranged between 30 cm and 45 cm, with sizes increasing from pass 1 to pass 2. The distribution of age-1 fish size observed in 2021 and 2022 was more variable compared to most other years. Additionally, the distribution of sizes in age-1 fish varied between 2021 and 2022, with age-1 fish being slightly smaller by pass in 2022 compared to 2021.

### NWFSC Slope Survey

The \gls{s-nslope} covered waters throughout the summer from 183 m to 1,280
m north of 34$^\circ$ 30$^\prime$ N. latitude, which is near Point Conception, from 1999 and 2002. The
survey sampled 80 fixed east - west transects of latitude, separated by 10 minutes of latitude.
Five stations in each transect were selected from two depth categories: shallow strata (184
- 549 m) and deep strata (550 - 1,280 m). There were a total of 400 possible stations to
sample from each year, with 302 - 327 successful tows on average per year. The survey was
conducted from mid-August to mid-October in 1998 but was somewhat earlier in 1999 and
2000 (late-June to late- September).

sdmTMB was used in a similar fashion to that specified for fitting the \gls{s-nslope}. The estimated index shows a relatively flat trajectory over the survey period except for the increase in 2000 (@fig-index-nwslope). Q-Q plots suggested that the gamma distribution (@fig-qq-nwfslope) fit the data, better than a log-normal distribution (results not shown). No spatial or spatiotemporal patterns were found in the Pearson residuals.

### AFSC/NWFSC West Coast Triennial Shelf Survey

The \gls{s-tri} was first conducted by the AFSC in 1977, and the survey continued
until 2004 [@weinberg_estimation_2002]. Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced east-to-west
transects across the continental shelf from which searches for tows in a specific depth range
were initiated. The survey design changed slightly over time. In general, all of the surveys
were conducted in the mid-summer through early fall. The 1977 survey was conducted from
early July through late September. The surveys from 1980 through 1989 were conducted
from mid-July to late September. The 1992 survey was conducted from mid-July through
early October. The 1995 survey was conducted from early June through late August. The
1998 survey was conducted from early June through early August. Finally, the 2001 and
2004 surveys were conducted from May to July.

Haul depths ranged from 91 - 457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower than 91
m. Due to haul performance issues and truncated sampling with respect to depth, the data
from 1977 were omitted from this analysis. The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the
U.S. west coast south to 36.8$^\circ$ N. latitude and a depth range of 55 - 366 m. The surveys in
1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern range to 34$^\circ$ 50$^\prime$ N.
latitude (near Point Conception). From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth
range 55 - 500 m and surveyed south to 34$^\circ$ 50$^\prime$ N. latitude. In 2004, the final year of the
\gls{s-tri} series, the NWFSC Fishery Resource and Monitoring division (FRAM)
conducted the survey following similar protocols to earlier years. Due to changes in survey
timing, the \gls{s-tri} data have been split into independent early (1980 - 1992) and
late (1995 - 2004) survey time series. The split of the time series was done in the base model
via a shift in catchability (Q) between the 1992 and 1995 survey years.

## Additional Data Considered

### AFSC Slope Survey

The \gls{s-aslope} operated during the months of October to November aboard the
R/V Miller Freeman. Partial survey coverage of the U.S. west coast occurred during the years
1988 - 1996 and complete coverage (north of 34$^\circ$ 30$^\prime$ N. latitude) during the years 1997 and
1999-2001. Typically, only these four years that are seen as complete surveys are included in
groundfish stock assessments.

### Natural Mortality


The current method for developing a prior on natural mortality for West Coast groundfish stock assessments is based on Hamel and Cope [-@hamel_development_2022], a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the $M$ rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on $M$. This approach modifies work done by Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] who estimated $M$ and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an $M$ estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending $M$ estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least squares estimator $M = 4.899A^{-0.916}_{\text{max}}$. Hamel and Cioe [-@hamel_development_2022] re-evaluated the data used by Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] by fitting the one-parameter $A_{\text{max}}$ model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space [@hamel_development_2022]), the point estimate and median of the prior for $M$ is:

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.5cm}

where $A_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum age. The prior is defined as a lognormal distribution with mean $ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})$ and standard error = 0.31.  

The maximum age for `r spp` was selected based on available age data from all West Coast data sources. The oldest aged `r spp` was 102 years, captured by the commercial fishery in 2006, not accounting for potential ageing error. Examining all aged fish, a maximum age of 75 was selected. Across all data sources there were limited observation greater than 75 years of age. There are a higher frequency of older males compared to females observed in the data, however, females grow to larger sizes and generally have higher fishery selectivity which may bias the sex-ratio of older individuals. Using a maximum age of 75, the median of the prior was 0.72 yr$^{-1}$ with a standard error of 0.31.

### Growth

Range-wide investigations of `r spp` growth suggest that growth varies across the northeastern Pacific, with a generally increasing cline in length-at-age with latitude [@mcdevitt1987sablefish, @echave2012fishbullinterdecadal, @gertseva2017icesjmsspatial, @kapur2020]. Break points in growth have been identified at around $50^\circ$N (approximately the northern end of Vancouver Island, Canada), where north of this breakpoint female asymptotic-length estimates were consistently over 70 cm and south of this breakpoint female asymptotic-length estimates were below 66 cm [@kapur2020]. A second break point was identified by [-kapur2020] at 36$^\circ$ N. latitude (approximately Monterey, California), where asymptotic size for females and males to the south were 60 cm and 55 cm, respectively. 

Female `r spp` generally reach larger sizes compared to males. For example, the  female `r spp` the upper 95 percent confidence interval of all observed lengths from the \gls{s-wcgbt} is 70 cm compared to 62 cm for males. However, the size at age for the oldest `r spp` is quite variable leading to uncertainty in the estimated maximum size for both females and males across assessments depending upon the data used to inform estimates. 

### Weight-at-Age {#watage}


### Maturity and Fecundity

New maturity reads and analysis was conducted by Melissa Head (NWFSC) and Dr. Eric Ward (NWFSC) to support this assessment. A total of `r dim(maturity_data)[1]` sablefish maturity samples were collected during the annual \gls{s-wcgbt} in 2010, 2015, 2018, 2021, and 2022 @tbl-maturity-samples. The maturity samples were evaluated for functional maturity that classifies maturity with developing oocytes as mature or immature. The maturity-at-age or -length estimates were evaluated north and south of 36$^\circ$ N. latitude. Of the samples processed, sablefish were identified to be mature as early as age `r min(maturity_data[which(maturity_data$Area == "North" & maturity_data$functional_maturity == 1), "age"])` and `r min(maturity_data[which(maturity_data$Area == "South" & maturity_data$functional_maturity == 1), "age"])` in the north and south, respectively.  Generally, across samples, sablefish matured at younger ages more frequently in the north compared to the south @fig-maturity-data. 

Maturity-at-age was estimated using a spatiotemporal model that explored the impacts of temperature, temporal changes in maturity, day of year, and location. Only sample location was determined to be significant in the model with the maturity curve right shifted (e.g., less probability of being mature at age) compared to fish in the north. A coastwide maturity curve was estimated by weighting the area specific curves using a biomass weighted prediction grid from the \gls{s-wcgbt}. The assessment uses the biomass weighted maturity curve (Spatial) @fig-maturity-ogive.

Available data suggests that `r spp` are determinate spawners (i.e., total oocytes at the beginning of the spawning season is equivalent to total annual spawning output) and spawn three to four times per year [@hunter1989; @macewicz1994]. The total number of oocytes at the beginning of the spawning season appears to be linearly proportional to weight [@hunter1989], implying that spawning output for a mature female is also proportional to weight. This assumption has been used in previous `r spp` stock assessments and is retained here in the absence of new information. Data on skipped spawning are unavailable, as are data on environmental effects or other factors that could cause fecundity to vary non-linearly with weight.

### Ageing Precision and Bias

Observed `r spp` ages are derived from visually counting rings on otoliths using 'break-and-burn' methods. These counts can be large because `r spp` are long-lived and the repeatability of individual age estimates is imperfect, especially for older fish. Age-reading staff have indicated that `r spp` can be difficult to age. The observed age can differ, sometimes substantially, from the true age of a fish (i.e., "reading error"). Ageing error can be decomposed into the difference between true age and average-read age (bias) and variability around that average read age (precision).  

The large majority of aged `r spp` used in the assessment were aged by the Cooperative Ageing Project (CAP).  Within-lab ageing error was estimated for CAP. Break-and-burn double reads of more than 12,000 otoliths were provided by the CAP lab (unpublished data).  An ageing error estimate was made based on these double reads using a computational tool specifically developed for estimating ageing error [@punt_quantifying_2008] and using release 2.02. of the R package \href{https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/nwfscAgeingError}{AgeingError} for input and output diagnostics. A linear standard error was estimated by age where there is more variability in the age of older fish (Figure XX). Sensitivities to alternative ageing error estimates (curvilinear relationship with age) were conducted during model development and the model was relatively insensitive to alternative ageing error assumptions. 

## Environmental/Ecosystem Indicator Data
