## Modeling Results

Parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation and uncertainty is based on the assumption of asymptotic multivariate normality of the maximum likelihood estimate, where the variance-covariance matrix is the inverse of the hessian matrix. A list
of fixed and estimated parameters in the model and asymptotic standard error estimates for estimated parameters is available in @tbl-param. The negative log likelihood components by data type are shown in @tbl-likes. Estimates of derived reference points and approximate 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in @tbl-ref-points. Estimates of stock size over time are shown in @tbl-ts.

### Parameter Estimates

The natural mortality for both females and males were estimated as a single parameter. Natural mortality was estimates to be `r m[1]` yr$^{-1}$ using a prior with the median of 0.072 yr$^{-1}$ with a standard error of 0.31 (@tbl-param and @fig-m-est-prior). Sensitivities to the treatment of natural mortality are shown in Section \ref{sensitivities}.

Age-based selectivity curves were estimated for the fishery and survey fleets using the double-normal selectivity parameterization in Stock Synthesis. The selectivity curves for the hook-and-line and pot gears were sex-specific while all other fishery and survey fleets were parameterized to have a single selectivity curve for both sexes. The estimated selectivity curves are shown in @fig-fishery-selex and @fig-survey-selex. ADD TEXT FOR FISHERY SELECTIVITY

The estimated selectivity for the early and late period for the gls{s-tri} were domed with the survey only selecting young fish. The early period of the \gls{s-tri}, 1980 -- 1992, sampled depths ranging form 55 -- 366 m with the estimated selectivity curve estimating full selectivity for ages 1 to 3, limited selectivity for age 4, and very low selectivity for older ages (e.g., 0.005). The late period of the \gls{s-tri}, 1995 -- 2004, extended the sampling out to 500 m.  The estimated selectivity for the late period was also domed with selectivity peaking at age 2, declining from ages 3 to 6, and low selectivity for older ages (e.g., 0.02). The estimated selectivity for the \gls{s-nslope} was estimated to be slightly domed, peaking for age 4, declining for age 5 and 6, then plateauing to a constant for older ages. The selectivity curve for the \gls{s-wcgbt} was similar to the selectivity for \gls{s-nslope}, the the selectivity for the \gls{s-wcgbt} was greater than zero for age-0, peaked at age 1, decreased for age 2, and plateauing to a constant level for older ages. The selectivity of age 0 fish, the steep increase, limited width at the peak, and the steep decrease in selectivity for the \gls{s-wcgbt} led to issues with parameters being estimated at parameter bounds requiring many of the selectivity parameters to be fixed. Future update and benchmark assessments for sablefish should evaluate if fixed parameters need to be updated based upon new data in order to retain the best fit to the survey data.     

Catchability for each of the surveys was analytically solved comparing observed to expected vulnerable biomass across all years for each survey. The catchability for the early and periods of the \gls{s-tri} was `r q[1, "Value"]` and `r q[2, "Value"]`, respectively. The cathability for the \gls{s-nslope} was `r q[3, "Value"]` and `r q[4, "Value"]` for the \gls{s-wcgbt}.  The catchability for the recruitment index was an estimated parameter.  The estimate for this index was `r q[5, "Value"]`.

Additional survey variability, process error added directly to each yearâ€™s input standard deviation for the late period of the \gls{s-tri} and \gls{s-nslope}.  The additional survey variability for each of these surveys was `r survey_add_sd[2, "Value"]` and `r survey_add_sd[3, "Value"]`, respectively.  No additional survey variability was needed to fit the trend in the early period of the \gls{s-tri}. No additional survey variability was estimated for the \gls{s-wcgbt} since this survey is considered to be a good sampling tool for sablefish and was considered a key data source that the model needed to fit. 

The time series of estimated recruitments and annual recruitment deviations are shown in @fig-recruits and @fig-recdevs. Years with the highest recruitment deviations were estimated to have occurred in `r top_recdevs[1, "years"]`, `r top_recdevs[2, "years"]`, `r top_recdevs[3, "years"]`, `r top_recdevs[4, "years"]`, and `r top_recdevs[5, "years"]`. The lowest annual recruitment deviations (e.g., negative deviations) were estimated to have occurred in `r low_recdevs[1, "years"]`, `r low_recdevs[2, "years"]`, `r low_recdevs[3, "years"]`, `r low_recdevs[4, "years"]`, and `r low_recdevs[5, "years"]`. Initial model explorations found that there was limited information in the data to inform annual recruitment deviations prior to 1975, with the base model opting to not estimate deviations for years prior to 1975. Estimated recruitment deviations during years with the majority of the age data, after 1990, have relatively low uncertainty intervals indicating support in the data for strong or poor recruitment years. The estimated annual recruitment deviation in 2024 is uncertain, but estiamted to be above average based upon data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} and the recruitment index. The recruitment bias adjustment applied within the model across years is shown in @fig-biasramp.

### Model Fits

The fit to the survey indices are shown in @fig-index-fit-early-triennial -- @fig-index-fit-wcgbt. The model fit the early period for the \gls{s-tri} well.  The late period for the \gls{s-tri} had an increasing trend in the index that the model generally fit, although additional survey variability was estimated in order to fit the 1998 and 2001 data. The model fit the trend between 1999 -- 2001, but estimated a higher vulnerable biomass in 1998 and lower in 2002 relative to the index for the \gls{s-nslope}. The model fit the trend in the \gls{s-wcgbt} index for most years, but the model trend was outside the uncertainty interval for the 2019 and 2022 data points. The fit to the recruitment index generally followed the trend in the data points (@fig-index-fit-enviro). 

Fits to the age data are shown based on the proportions of age observed across all years and the Pearson residuals-at-age for all fleets. Age composition aggregated fits by fleet are reasonably well fit and are shown in @fig-aggregate-age-fit.

For the \gls{s-tri}, in 1983 and 1989 there was a slight overfitting for females and underfitting of males and a generall good fit in 1992 (@fig-pearson-tri-early). The model fit the mean age for 1983, 1986, and 1992 which was generally flat over the survey period (@fig-mean-age-tri-early). For the late period of the \gls{s-tri}, in 1995 there were more older ages observed that where the observations were greater than expected compared compared to 2004 (@fig-pearson-tri-late). The base model predicted a drop in mean age for this survey between 1995 and 2004 which matched the trend for mean age in the data (@fig-mean-age-tri-late). The model fit the age data from the \gls{s-nslope} with no clear patter in residuals across years (@fig-pearson-nwfsc-slope). The model predicted a larger drop in the mean age between 2001 and 2002 which was not observed in the data from this survey (@fig-mean-age-nwfsc-slope).

### Population Trajectory

The predicted spawning output is given in @tbl-ts and plotted in @fig-sb.  The predicted spawning output time series shows a slow decline in spawning output from 1890 -- 1980 and a rapid decline from 1981 -- 2000 from the fishery ramping up with large removals starting in the mid-1970s. Since 2001, the spawning output  remaining at lower levels until approximately 2017 and then sharply increases starting in 2018. The recent increase in spawning output is being driven the the strong 2016 cohort and the proportion of mature fish from the strong 2020 cohort. The summary biomass of fish age 3 and older has a steeper increase at the end of the time series from both the 2020 and 2021 strong cohorts (@fig-summary-biomass). The estimated total biomass follows a similar trend as the summary biomass but with even a more dramatic increase at the end of the time series (@fig-total-biomass). The fraction of unfished is estimated to have declined below the management target in 1988 and continued to decline until 2013 (@tbl-ts and @fig-depl). Since 2014, the fraction of unfished has steadily increased due to the 2008 cohort and has continued to increase from additional strong recruitments.  The fraction of unfished in `r end_year` is estimated to be `r 100*depl_final` percent, below the management target, but projected to surpass the management target in 2027 (@tbl-ts).     

The stock-recruit curve resulting from a value of steepness fixed at `r h` is shown in @fig-sb-recr with estimated recruitments also shown. Steepness
was not estimated in this model, but a likelihood profile across steepness values is shown in Section \ref{profile}.
