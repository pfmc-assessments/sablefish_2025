## Modeling Results

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors (SD column) are shown in @tbl-param and the likelihood components are shown in @tbl-likes. Estimates of derived reference points and approximate 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in @tbl-ref-points. Estimates of stock size over time are shown in @tbl-ts.

### Population Trajectory

The predicted spawning output is given in @tbl-ts and plotted in @fig-sb.  The predicted spawning output time series shows a slow decline in spawning output from 1890 -- 1980 and a rapid decline from 1981 -- 2000 from the fishery ramping up with large removals starting in the mid-1970s. Since 2001, the spawning output  remaining at lower levels until approximately 2017 and then sharply increases starting in 2018. The recent increase in spawning output is being driven the the strong 2016 cohort and the proportion of mature fish from the strong 2020 cohort. The summary biomass of fish age 3 and older has a steeper increase at the end of the time series from both the 2020 and 2021 strong cohorts (@fig-summary-biomass). The estimated total biomass follows a similar trend as the summary biomass but with even a more dramatic increase at the end of the time series (@fig-total-biomass). The fraction of unfished is estimated to have declined below the management target in 1988 and continued to decline until 2013 (@tbl-ts and @fig-depl). Since 2014, the fraction of unfished has steadily increased due to the 2008 cohort and has continued to increase from additional strong recruitments.  The fraction of unfished in `r end_year` is estimated to be `r 100*depl_final` percent, below the management target, but projected to surpass the management target in 2027 (@tbl-ts).
