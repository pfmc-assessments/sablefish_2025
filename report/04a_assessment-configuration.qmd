# Assessment

## History of Modeling Approaches

The first `r spp` stock assessment was completed in 1984 [@francis1984sablefish], followed by frequent assessments since then (e.g., @francis1985sablefish, @mcdevitt1987sablefish, @methot1988sablefish, @methot1989sablefish, @methot1990sablefish, @methot1992, @methot1994, @crone1997sablefish, @methot1998sablefish, @schirripa2001sablefish, @schirripa2002sablefish, @schirripa2005sablefish, @schirripa2007sablefish, @stewart2011sablefish, @johnson2016sablefish, @haltuch_status_2019, @kapur_status_2021, @johnson_status_2023). Previous assessments have largely drawn the similar conclusions regarding historical trends. Since the 1970s, the `r spp` resource has show a rapid, persistent decline due to many years with low recruitment and high fishing intensity during 1970s and 1980s. Uncertainty regarding the absolute scale of the `r spp` population has remained high, with previous assessment models suggesting that unfished spawning biomass ranges between just under 100,000 mt up to approximately 250,000 mt.

The 1984 assessment examined catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data from the 1979 to 1983 \gls{nmfs} pot survey [@francis1984sablefish] Subsequent stock assessments were based on age-structured frameworks of varying complexity. The 1985 age-structured assessment utilized a simulation model, estimating $M$, average weight-at-age, recruitment, and relative age-specific catchability, to examine maximum sustainable yield ($MSY$). The model relied on \gls{nmfs} trawl and pot surveys as well as parameter estimates generated from independent research. The 1987 `r spp` assessment extended the NMFS survey time-series and primarily consisted of a modified yield-per-recruitment analysis focusing on the minimum size limit (22 inches) implemented in 1983.

In 1988, a catch-at-age analysis using an early version of the Stock Synthesis modeling framework, which is the basis for all subsequent assessments, was implemented [@methot1988sablefish] This model included two fleets, fixed gear and trawl, and two years of fishery biological data. NMFS trawl and pot surveys provided indices of abundance, and estimates of exploitation rate were based on tag-recapture information generated from a tagging study that began in 1971. The 1989 `r spp` stock assessment followed a similar approach; revisions in the age-determination criteria for `r spp` caused an increase in the observed proportion of old fish and a decrease in the estimate of $M$ from 0.15 to 0.09. The 1990 `r spp` assessment [@methot1990sablefish] explicitly modeled stock structure with a northern population (U.S. Vancouver and Columbia INPFC areas) and a southern population (Eureka, Monterey, and Conception INPFC areas). Including spatial structure was motivated by differences in growth rates and the perception of low migration rates. The spatial models facilitated comparisons between and amongst areas with signals in the raw data.

In 1992, the assessment reverted to a single stock area, excluding the Conception INPFC area [@methot1992] Data from the \gls{s-tri} were used to extrapolate survey estimates to the entire assessment area (Monterey through U.S. Vancouver INPFC areas). Analysis focused on exploring the trade-off in fitting the trawl-survey biomass and the trend from the pot survey. The depth stratified age- and length-composition data suggested that movement of `r spp` into deep water was more closely related to their age than size. The 1994 `r spp` assessment [@methot1994] was similar to the 1992 analysis. The survey was used as an absolute measure of biomass after extrapolation to the coast-wide level. The 1997 assessment [@crone1997sablefish] added CPUE data. No single model was found that fit all indices well. The 1998 assessment [@methot1998sablefish] focused on the inclusion and exclusion of the pot survey index and the use of commercial logbook CPUE.

The 2001 assessment [@schirripa2001sablefish] focused on evaluating the sensitivity of the results to the treatment of the survey data and trade-offs among pot survey and logbook indices of abundance. This assessment was the first to introduce the possibility that `r spp` recruitment may be linked to environmental factors. The 2002 assessment [@schirripa2002sablefish] was an update to [@schirripa2001sablefish] and focused mainly on newly available data from existing sources. It was the first assessment to detect the strong 1999 and 2000 cohorts in the 2001 data, following many years of below average recruitment. A significant relationship between recruitment and sea level was identified.

Several important changes were made to the `r spp` assessment in 2005 [@schirripa2005sablefish]. Landings and the modeled time-period were extended back to the year 1900. Separate selectivity curves were implemented for the trawl surveys, and years with limited geographic coverage in the \gls{s-tri} were eliminated. Discard data from the relatively new observer program were included and discard mortality was investigated. Sea level was used as an explicit offset in the population dynamics to expected recruitment.

The 2007 assessment [@schirripa2007sablefish] included newly available data and changed the treatment of the sea level index of recruitment within the stock assessment model to be a survey index of recruitment with observation error, rather than an explicit offset in the population dynamics to expected recruitment. The assessment made the explicit assumption that catchability for the \gls{s-wcgbt} was equal to 0.56, which was modeled by using only the shelf region. Uncertainty was investigated and reported primarily through alternate values for catchability.

The 2011 stock assessment [@stewart2011sablefish] reduced the number of parameters used to model fishery dynamics. Historical management actions were condensed to those that had a strong influence on fishery behavior (e.g., sorting and retention, selectivity, or both). Previously fixed leading parameters, $M$ and trawl survey catchability, were estimated or used analytical solutions. Changes lead to increased, more realistic, estimates of uncertainty around stock size estimates. Repeated testing of the correlation between sea level and recruitment continued to find a significant relationship that explained approximately 35 percent of the variability in recruitment deviations. The sea-level data was used from 1970 forward, a period with length- and age-composition data, and was not retained in the base model because the index provided a recruitment signal largely consistent with that provided by the composition data. Finally, the large number of deviations about annual growth and annual selectivity curves estimated in the 2007 model were reduced, with the net effect that uncertainty was increased. The sensitivity of model results to ($M$), equilibrium recruitment, and steepness ($h$), which was estimated prior to 2011, was investigated via likelihood profiles. The 2015 stock assessment [@johnson2016sablefish] was an update to the 2011 stock assessment, maintaining the same model structure and focused on adding the new data and retuning data weights in the model given the new data.

In 2019 a new benchmarck stock assessment for sablefish was conducted that evaluated the model structure used in previous assessments and incorportated a new environment index to inform estimate of recruitment [@haltuch_status_2019].  The 2019 assessment continued to model discarding and retention similar to previous assessments, but simplified the fleet structe to two commercial fleets: trawl and a fixed gear fleet that combine pot and hook-and-line gears.  Selectivity continued to be parameterized as age-based, but the 2019 assessment opted to model selectivity for all fleets using a double-normal parameterization, moving away from using spline-based parameterization used in the previous assessment for the fishery fleets. Selectivity for all fishery and survey fleets were estimated to dome-shaped, similar to the 2011 assessment.  The assessment estimated that fraction of unfished to be just below the management target (e.g., 40 percent) at 39 percent.  In 2021 and 2023 update assessment were conducted that focused on adding new data while retaining the 2019 model structure [@kapur_status_2021; @johnson_status_2023].  The 2021 update assessment updated all data and estimated the stock at 58 percent of fraction unfished [@kapur_status_2021]. Finally, the 2023 update assessment was considered a "limited" update where only recent catches were added and the \gls{s-wcgbt} data added.  The 2023 limited update assessment estimated very strong recent recruitments (e.g., 2020 and 2021) and a fraction of unfished of 63 percent.


## Most Recent STAR Panel Recommendations

The [STAR Panel Report](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2019/10/sablefish-star-panel-report-july-8-12-2019.pdf/) from the 2019 benchmark assessment made the following suggestions:

*Short Term*

**Recommendation**: To understand whether regional differences in growth, and associated size or age composition,
are behind the strong tensions observed in age and length composition data, future assessment models should evaluate having separate fixed gear fleets north and south of 36$^\circ$ N (as discussed in unresolved problems and major uncertainties). The potential merits of other regional differences in fleet structure could also be explored. 

**Response**: The STAT explored using regional based fleet, however, there are limited age data available south of 36$^\circ$ N. latitude which prevented further exploration of this approach. The STAT attempted to account for time-varying growth and regional growth by using a empirical weight-at-age approach with the annual weight-at-age applying a biomass weighted approach to estimate a weight-at-age that account for biomass and weight-at-age north and south of 36$^\circ$ N. latitude.


**Recommendation**: Future assessments should consider the use of empirical weights-at-age. One approach would be to begin with the WCGBT data and use it to fit (outside model) a smoother outside the model (see Jim Ianelli for code that uses a random effects model to estimate weights using empirical
data by cohort and year). This would avoids confounding weight at age with growth estimates (e.g., Lee et al. 2019, Whitten et al. 2013), should allow the model to run faster, and should enable the model to better accommodate variability in growth (in both age and over time). Another advantage is that somatic body masses are based on actual measurements instead of model estimates which predicts mean length and then converts length to mass via a fixed set of length-weight parameters

**Response**: The STAT agreed with this recommendation and is now using a empirical weight-at-age approach in this assessment.

**Recommendation**: Consider (and potentially adopt) length based selectivity for the WCGBTS, as selectivity bias could lead to observed age zero fish not being a good representation of mean length at age 0 (which could affect estimates of growth). [Figure 13](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2019/10/sablefish-star-panel-report-july-8-12-2019.pdf/#page = 28) shows some summary results of this issue, including the lack of apparent growth of age 0 sablefish during the period of the survey. A related issue is that specifying the size at age 0.5 (or 1.5), as well as the CV, should be in common by sex. Dimorphic growth presumably occurs at older ages. Future assessments should consider configuring “offsets” for sex differences in the growth. The rationale for this change is that differences between sexes at such young ages seem unlikely and re-configuring the model in this way will reduce the number of parameters needed.

**Response**: This assessment retained age-based selectivity for the \gls{s-wcgbt} in order to incorporate an empirical weight-at-age approach.  The weight-at-age was informed using data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} and should better capture the variation in size-at-age across time.

**Recommendation**: Examine age-specific selectivity that is fixed at a “plus group” age (or have a reasonable
rationale as to why selectivity might be changing over those ages).

**Response**: The selectivities for all fleets in the model estimated a fixed selectivity for older ages.

**Recommendation**: Provide estimates of retention external to the model and evaluate if the approach of doing it
within the model (and then fixing the values because of discard length composition data affecting
model results other than the shape of the retention curve).

**Response**: This assessment moved to a discard fleet approach because there were concerns about model stability with retention being estimated within the model. The discard totals were estimated external to the model and the selectivity for the discard fleets were estimated using estimated discard ages.

**Recommendation**: Reconsider spline or some other non-parametric selectivity forms, as there are unexpected
behaviors observed in estimating double normal selectivities for the fixed gear fishery. The
requirement (apparently) to have to fix the “P6” parameter related to old sablefish selectivity and
some other interactions seems unusual, and several of the convergence issues were related to
selectivity parameters for some gear types/surveys. The 2015 model used a different form for
selectivity and the document provided little justification to choose one over the other. “Fewer
parameters” is a poor reason if performance overall is so much worse. The convergence
problems did seem to be largely resolved after the STAT fixed the CV of young ages.

**Response**:  The STAT explored splines for fishery and survey fleets in the model, but were not found to improve the fits to the data compared to the double-normal selectivity.  

**Recommendation**: The CAAL plots suggest that in the early years of the WCGBTS the residuals of the biggest fish
were generally “young” and in the more recent years the pattern of observed and predicted were more consistent. This could be due to changes in growth and/or size (or age) based selectivity/availability changes and should be investigated. 

**Response**: The STAT agrees that there appeared to be periods where the conditional-age-at-length residuals were generally positive or negative.  The empirical weight-at-age approach explicitly accounts for potential time-varying growth by year.

**Recommendation**: Developing diagnostics that better evaluate sex ratio observations against model predictions
would be useful, especially given some of the differences observed in the fisheries selectivities
estimates and in sex specific natural mortality configurations compared to combined sexes
natural mortality.

**Response**: The `r4ss` package now includes improved sex ratio figures. Additionally, the sex ratio of observed ages for all fishing and survey fleets were evaluated to determine whether sex-specific selectivity was occurring. The hook-and-line and pot gear have greater selectivity for females compared to males which could lead to changes in sex ratios of selected fish over time.  The STAT did not find clear evidence for differing natural mortality rates by sex and a single natural mortality for both sexes.  

**Recommendation**: Reducing the number of ages should be considered, as the plus group information and dynamics
beyond some ages are unlikely to change (as shown in [Figure 14]((https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2019/10/sablefish-star-panel-report-july-8-12-2019.pdf/#page = 29))).

**Response**: The STAT agrees that the data plus group of age-50 may be larger than necessary and future assessments should continue to evaluate this, but given the other extensive model structure changes in this assessment a data plus group of age-50 was retained.

**Recommendation**: Continuing to evaluate the use of sea level and/or other environmental indicators as drivers of
both historic and future recruitments is strongly encouraged, and future assessments should strive
to clearly convey how such data explicitly relate to recruitment as well as to convey the logic and
presumed mechanisms behind the relationship.

**Response**:  The assessment opted to use a recruitment index that covered the last five years of the model given that there are significant survey and fishery data to inform recruitment estimation for earlier years.  Additionally, preliminary research conducted by Dr. Kiva Oken (Northwest Fisheries Science Center) determined that including longer time series of recruitment indices may bias estimates of stock size and recommended that these indices be isolated to periods where there are little to no information about recruitment from other data sources in the model.

*Medium and Long Term*

**Recommendation**: The panel had concerns about the large amount of data and the challenges faced doing things
such as estimating natural mortality and the CVs on growth and other factors. However, the core
growth parameters were generally stable, and convergence problems are not atypical when
natural mortality is difficult to estimate and selectivity patterns are all dome-shaped. The panel
notes that it is worth reflecting on whether a somewhat different modeling approach would work
better (in the longer term). The nature of the issues in the data may be stretching the capacity of
the analytical framework and software to do what needs to be done.

**Response**: The STAT agrees that estimating growth, natural mortality, selectivity, and retention with this assessment could lead to an unstable model (e.g., variable estimates across sensitivities, and/or inability to invert the hessian).  To address these issues this assessment made significant efforts to simplify the model structure and to improve paramaterization of key processes.

**Recommendation**: The STAT provided very helpful updates on ongoing efforts to evaluate life history
characteristics, movement patterns and management approaches throughout the range of
sablefish in the Northeast Pacific. The STAR Panel agrees with the STAT that ongoing and
future work, such as efforts to develop a transboundary stock assessment and management
framework, be pursued. This is based on strong indications that current stock boundaries are
likely to be inappropriate, and that a transboundary assessment would likely improve the ability
to estimate the scale of the population.

**Response**: This STAT agrees that work should continue to evaluate coherence of sablefish across the Northeast Pacific, emigration, and migration rates across assessment boundaries.

**Recommendation**: As the WCGBTS is highly informative in the model, maintaining full coastwide survey effort is
essential. However, currently the survey does not include a large fraction of the habitat south of
36$^\circ$ N, the cowcod conservation areas. Despite a lack of data in this large area, catch is allocated north and south of 36$^\circ$ N based on the estimated fraction of sablefish in these areas, and this fraction, in turn, is based on an extrapolation of survey catch rates outside the CCAs to those
inside. As fish within the CCAs are only subject to fishing pressure if and when they move, and
movement rates are variable, this concentration of effort outside of the CCAs could potentially
lead to localized depletion, which in turn could bias the signal in fishery (and potentially survey)
age and length composition from the fished areas. It would be beneficial to have survey data
from within the CCAs to inform the survey, and to allow for some evaluation of whether and
how population structure may vary inside and outside of the CCAs. There could be some
potential for local depletion elsewhere as well, given the concentration of trawl effort off of
Oregon and Washington and the decline in fishing effort and catches of both trawl and fished
gear in California north of 36$^\circ$ N.

**Response**:  The STAT attempted to evaluate the proportion of trawlable habitat south of 34$^\circ$ 47$^\prime$ N. latitude but did not have time to complete this analysis. The STAT notes that a spatio-temporal model is currently used to estimated the index of abundance for the \gls{s-wcgbt} which can incorporate spatial and temporal information to smooth estiamtes across sampled and unsampled areas. However, composition data are limited by areas sampled and if there are differences in sablefish abundance, size or age structured in unsampled areas these will not be accounted for in the biological data.   

**Recommendation**: For the WCGBTS, evaluate cohort total mortality ($Z$) for consistency and as a check with model
values. Comparing the survey estimate numbers at age over time (e.g., relative abundance at age
2 in year $y$ compared to abundance at age 3 in year $y+1$). 

**Response**: The STAT did not have sufficient time to address this recommendation and agrees that future STAT should work to understand cohort mortality.

**Recommendation**: Better estimates of aging error, bias and continued efforts to improve on age validation remain
high research priorities. 

**Response**: This assessment incorporated an updated ageing error estimate of uncertainty and bias using Template Model Builder which can account for random effects.  The STAT agrees that future work should be done to improve age validation which can improve our understanding of the population and age-structure for sablefish off the U.S. West Coast.


## Model Structure and Assumptions

### Modeling Platform and Structure

The assessment was conducted used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.24 developed by Dr. Richard Methot at the NOAA, NWFSC [@MethotWetzel2013]. This most recent version was used because it included improvements and corrections to older model versions. Previous assessments of sablefish also used Stock Synthesis but an earlier version, 3.30.21; model bridging was performed between both versions of Stock Synthesis and discussed below. The `R` package `r4ss`, version 1.51.0, along with `R` version 4.4.1 were used to investigate and plot model fits.

### Model Selection and Evaluation

The base assessment model for Dover sole was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning biomass trajectory for the population of Dover sole off the west coast of the U.S. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model.

### Model Changes from the Last Assessment

A number of data and modeling changes were made in this assessment relative to the previous benchmark assessment [@haltuch_status_2019]:

- All available data were reprocessed and extended through 2024.
- Hook-and-line and pot gear were split into separate fleets compared to the previous assessment that combined these data into a single fixed gear fleet.
- The index and age data from the \gls{s-aslope} were not included in the base model due to issues with the age data.
- The \gls{s-tri} was split into two separate survey fleets with indices with estimates of catchability and selectivity.  The early period ranged from 1980--1992 and the late period 1995--2004.  The previous assessment modeled this as a single survey with a change in catchability and selected selectivity parameters between the early and late period. Splitting this survey into two separate indices allowed for more unique estimation of selectivity and separate data weighting between the early and late period. Additionally, select years of age data were excluded due to concerns that they were not representative due to limited spatial coverage across tows.
- This assessment incorporated a new shorter environmental index to inform the estimates of recruitment.  The previous assessment used an environmental index based upon sea surface height from 1925-2018.  The new environmental index were based on a GLORYS model informed by a number of environmental covariates that ranged from 2019-2024. This newer index approach was selected since the estimation of historical recruitments should be well informed by data and that recruitment near the end of the model period can be the most uncertain due to limited observations.
- An new evaluation of ageing error conducted and the assumed bias and uncertainty were updated.
- This assessment incorporates new research on maturity moving from maturity-at-length to maturity-at-age. The coastwide maturity-at-age vector was estimated using a spatial modeling approach that supported the development of a biomass-weighted maturity curve to better account for variation in maturity-at-age by area.
- Empirical weight-at-age was used in this assessment to account for time-varying growth by age and year.
- The prior assumed for natural mortalility was updated based upon new research.
- Steepness continues to be fixed at an assumed value. However, due the lack of research on sablefish productivity and resiliancy, steepness is fixed at 0.75 in this assessment to align with the proxy reference points used for management of the stock off the U.S. West Coast. 
- This assessment opted to model removals via discard fleets for each gear type. The discard fleet approach was considered to be more transparent, allowing separate selectivity for retained and discarded fish, and improved model stability.
- This assessment simplified the modeling of changing selectivity (e.g., blocks) by management changes where possible.
- Natural mortality continues to be estimated, but is estimated to be equal between female and males.
- Annual recruitment deviations were only estimated starting in 1975 with recruitment between 1890 -- 1974 assumed to be equal to be equal to the stock-recruitment curve.
- Recruitment deviations were estimated as simple deviations (recruitment deviation option two in Stock Synthesis) rather than a deviation vector with a sum to zero constraint (option one in Stock Synthesis).


### Key Assumptions and Structural Choices

The specification of the assessment are listed in @tbl-model-config. The model is a two-sex, age-structured model starting in 1890 with an accumulated population age group at 70 years. Natural mortality was estimated and assumed to be time invariant and equal between males and females.  An empirical weight-at-age approach was implemented wit with sex-specific time-varying growth between 2003 -- 2024. Lengths in the population were tracked in 1 cm intervals between 4 -- 90 cm. However, the use a weight-at-age approah results with population length calculations being bypassed in the model. The ages in the population were tracked by 1 year intervals between 0 -- 70 years of age and the age data were grouped by age between 0 -- 50 with 50 being used as data plus group.  Summary biomass was calculated for ages 3 plus. The sablefish population off the U.S. West Coast was modeled as a single area with only one season per year and a coastwide growth pattern by sex via the weight-at-age approach. 

Selectivity was age-based and modeled by fleet with time blocks on selectivity to allow for shifts in selectivity for each fishery fleet: retained/total removals and discard fleets. The selectivity between hook-and-line were mirrored (e.g., data combined to estimate selectivity for both gear types) due to similarity in the composition data between the gears.  The trawl fleet and each of the discard fleets (trawl, hook-and-line, and pot) estimated fleet specific selectivities. The mirrored hook-and-line and pot fleets also allowed for sex-specific selectivity with females having a higher selectivity by these gears compared to males. The trawl, hook-and-line, and pot gears had time blocks between 1890 -- 2001 and 2002 -- 2024 to account for the implementation of the rockfish conservation areas that eliminating fishing in select depth ranges across the coast. The trawl and hook-and-line discard fleets assumed three time blocks: 1890 -- 2010, 2011 -- 2018, and 2019 -- 2024 to account for implementation of the \gls{ifq} system in 2011 and the adoption of discard mortality rates by management in 2019 allowing for quota accounts to be credited for esimated survival of discarded fish.  The pot discard fleet assumed two time blocks: 1890 -- 2010 and 2011 -- 2024, with early model development determining that an additional block for 2019 -- 2024 had little to no impact on the model fits to the age data for this fleet. 

The specification of when to estimate recruitment deviations is an assumption that affects not only the estimate of early model uncertainty around stock scale and status but can impact the fits to composition data. Extensive model explorations were conducted to determine the appropriate range of years to estimate recruitment deviations. This assessment opted to not include recruitment deviations early in the model period, when data were not available, and begun estimation in 1975 based upon when the estimates appearred to be informed by data. The earliest age-composition data occur in 1983. The estimates of recruitment deviations from 1975 -- 2023 were considered within the "main period" and 2024 as the "late period" within Stock Synthesis. A bias adjustment was applied between 1974 -- 2024 with no bias adjustment applied during the projection period (e.g., 2025 -- 2036). @methot_adjusting_2011 summarize the reasoning behind varying levels of bias adjustment based on the information available to estimate the deviates. The standard deviation of recruitment variability was assumed to be `r sigma_r` based on the estimated variation in recruitment from the base model.

The following distributions were assumed for data fitting: survey indices were lognormal, the environmental index were normal, and the age-composition data had a multinomial error structure.

### Estimated and Fixed Parameters

There were 99 estimated parameters in the base model. These included one parameter for $R_0$ parameterized in log-space, one parameter for natural mortality, two parameters for extra variability for the survey indices, one parameter for catchability for the environmental index, 32 parameters for age-based selectivity and time blocking of the fishery and the surveys fleets, 50 recruitment deviations, and 12 projected recruitment deviations (@tbl-n-param). 

Fixed parameters in the model were as follows. Steepness was fixed at `r h`. Maturity-at-age was fixed in the model and fecundity was assumed equal to body weight. Sex-specific empirical weight-at-age by year was estimated external to the model to account for growth and growth variation by year and age. The standard deviation of recruitment deviates was fixed at `r sigma_r`, the same value assumed in the last assessment.  

Select selectivity parameters were estimated for all fishery and survey fleets in the model. All fleets were allowed to estimate dome-shaped selectivity.  The selectivity between the hook-and-line and pot fleets were assumed equal (e.g., mirrored) and incorporated sex-specific selectivity with females being more selected compared to males.  The trawl fleet, each discard fleet, and survey fleets assumed equal selectivity for females and males. The decision about whether this mirror selectivity among fleets and whether to allow for sex-specific selectivity were based upon explorations of the data and modeling.

### Priors

A prior were used for natural mortality ($M$) in the base model. The base model estimated natural mortality with a prior distribution based on the @hamel_development_2022 meta-analytic approach with an assumed maximum age of 75 years for both males and females. The prior assumed a log normal distribution for natural mortality. The log normal prior has a median of 0.072 yr$^{-1}$ and a standard error of 0.31. The prior was assumed the same for each sex during early model development with the base model estimating a single natural mortality for both sexes.

The treatment of steeness ($h$) has varied across recent assessment given the lack of research about sablefish productivity and resiliency. The assessment conducted in 2007 estimated $h$ = 0.43, the 2011 assessment fixed $h$ = 0.60 based upon @he_prior_2006, and the 2019 assessment fixed $h$ = 0.70. This assessment opted to fix $h$ at `r h` with a prior with an assumed beta distribution with mean of `r h` and standard error of 0.15. A value of `r h` was selected and based upon the range of values that appeared to be supported based upon data and current understanding about life history. Additionally, a value of `r h` aligns with \gls{pfmc} adopted reference points for sablefish. 

### Data Weighting

Age data from each fishery and survey fleet were fit and appropriately weighted within the model. Age data started with a sample size determined from the equation listed in Section  \ref{fishery-bds-data} for fish fishing fleets in the model. Input sample sizes for survey age data were calculated according to the method described in Section \ref{wcgbt-data}. 

Extra variability parameters were estimated and added to the input variance for the indices of abundance for two surveys in the model; 1) the late \gls{s-tri} (1995 -- 2004) and 2) the \gls{s-nslope}. Estimating additional variance for the early \gls{s-tri} (1980 -- 1992) was explored but not found to be necessary.  The \gls{s-wcgbt} is considered to sample sablefish off the U.S. West Coast well and no additional variance was estimated to ensure that the model fit this index. 

The base model was weighted using the Francis method, which was based on equation TA1.8 in Francis [@Francis2011]. Sensitivities were performed examining the difference between the McAllister Ianelli [@mcallister_bayesian_1997] method (Harmonic Mean weighting) and the Francis data weighting. The weights applied to the age data by fleet for the base model are shown @tbl-data-weights.


### Bridging Analysis {#bridging}

An extensive bridging analysis was conducted to detail the transition from the previous assessment to the base model.  The bridging analysis is presented in three sections: 1) Stock Synthesis version, 2) data updating and minor model structure changes, 3) major model structure changes. Updating the version of Stock Synthesis did not result in changes in estimated parameters and the derived spawning output (@fig-ss3-version).

The data bridging process, where data were reprocessed and updated through 2024, were conducted in an additive fashion. Given the extensive changes to the data and the model structure that were targeted to improve model stability (e.g., estimating informed parameters) and transparency developing the bridging process to reflect key changes was challenging. Model explorations and changes are often not made in a completely linear fashion. In the bridging presented, changes were grouped for clarity, particularly within the major model structure bridging section, and may not be presented in the order that they were originally decided during modeling development. This non-linear model development and the needed linear bridging has led to some steps in the bridging process to show larger changes in model estimates compared to what was observed when these model structure or parameter changes were decided. Given this, it is recommended to consider both the bridging and the sensitivities for the base model in tandem (see Section \ref{sensitivities} for base model sensitivities).     

The order of data updating and minor model structure changes were:

1. Remove the sea surface height environmental index.
2. Update landings for trawl and fixed gears from 1890 -- 2022 and add new landings 2023 -- 2024.  
3. Reprocess fishery ages from 1983 -- 2022 and add new ages from 2023 -- 2024.
4. Reprocess fishery discard rates for trawl and fixed gears from 2002 -- 2021 and add 2022.
5. Reprocess fishery discard lengths and mean body weights for trawl and fixed gears from 2002 -- 2021 and add 2022.
6. Split landings, discard, and age data from the fixed gear fleet into two separate fleets: hook-and-line and pot gears
7. Revise and fix selectivitiy and retention blocks based upon data and extend through 2024.
8. Reprocess indices of abundance and age composition data from the \gls{s-tri}, \gls{s-aslope}, and \gls{s-nslope}.
9. Reprocess and extend the index of abundance, length compositions, and conditional-age-at-length data from the \gls{s-wcgbt}. 
10. Update maturity from maturity-at-length to maturity-at-age based upon new research.
11. Update the natural mortality prior for female and males with a median of 0.072 yr$^{-1}$ and a standard error of 0.31. Continue to estimate sex-specific natural mortality.
12. Update the ageing error bias and uncertainty based using available double-read information through 2024.

Removing the sea surface height environmental index and updating and extending landings had limited impact on the estimated summary biomass and fraction unfished (@fig-data-bridge-ssb-1 and @fig-data-bridge-depl-1). Reprocessing and extending the fishery ages reduced the overall scale of summary biomass and a more reduced fraction unfished across all model years. Data and model explorations determined that the change in estimates from the 2023 assessment was due to inclusion of additional historical ages (e.g., 1983 -- 2010) that were not included in previous assessments.  @tbl-fixed-age-samples-comp compares the number of ages by year and gear group between this assessment and the 2019 assessment. The revised age data primarily was collected in Oregon and we excluded due to the lack of information about the ageing method (e.g., break and burn, surface read, etc.) or were marked as special samples in the \gls{odfw} database. After conversations with staff at \gls{odfw} and \gls{cap} it was determined that ageing methodology has been generally consistent across time for sablefish and that these samples are likely read via break-and-burn, consistent with current methodology, and that records marked as special samples in early years of PacFIN data were randomly collected market samples similar to current sampling programs and that these data should be included in the assessment. Reprocessing and extending the fishery discard rates resulted in a reduced estimate of summary biomass relative and fraction unfished across the time series compared to the previous model (e.g., +fishery ages model, @fig-data-bridge-ssb-1 and @fig-data-bridge-depl-1). The methodology used to discard rates was improved for this assessment compared to previous assessments, which resulted in modest increases in the discard rates primarily for the fixed gear fleet (e.g., hook-and-line and pot, see Section \ref{discards} for additional information). Reprocessing and extending the mean discard weights and length compositions resulted in only minor changes to estimates. 

Splitting hook-and-line landings, discard, and age composition data into separate fleets resulted in generally small decreases to the estimated summary biomass and fraction unfished. During the process of splitting out hook-and-line and pot gear fleets, some issue were identified with the time blocks applied to the fishery selectivity and retention parameters resulting in some parameters within time blocks being estimated in the absence of data (age or discard length compositions) and the blocks were simplified accordingly ensure data were available to inform estimates. Finally, the blocks were extended to 2024. These fixes in the bridging model resulted in an increase estimated summary biomass and fraction unfished compared to the previous model (e.g., Split Fixed Gear, @fig-data-bridge-ssb-2 and @fig-data-bridge-depl-2). Reprocessing historical survey based on current best practices resulted in only minor changes in model estimates. Reprocessing and extending the index of abundance, length compositions, and conditional-age-at-length data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} slightly reduced the estimates summary biomass across the time series but had limited impact on the estimated fraction unfished. Adding the new maturity-at-age changed the scale of summary biomass across the time series but did not change the fraction unfished (@fig-data-bridge-ssb-2 and @fig-data-bridge-depl-2). The final two revisions in the data bridging section, updating the prior for natural mortality (i.e., continuing to estimate natural mortality) and the ageing error bias and uncertainty resulted in only minor changes in model estimates.

In summary, across the data bridging, including all available age data had the largest impact in the model estimates.  The new discard rates that incorporated an improved methodology to calculate gear-specific discard rates across fishery sectors resulted in the next most change in model estimates.  

This assessment made a number of structural changes to the model. The order of major structural and data changes were:

13. Move the start of the main period for estimated annual recruitment deviations from 1925 to 1975 to align with the period of available data to inform recruitment and only start estimating recruitment deviations at the start of the model (1890).
14. Only estimate annual recruitment deviations starting in 1975 (e.g., no annual recruitment deviations between 1890 -- 1974).
15. Remove the index of abundance and age composition data from the \gls{s-aslope}.
16. Split out foreign catches from the domestic trawl, hook-and-line, and pot fleets and replace discard lengths with the estimated discard ages. The model has six fishery fleets: three domestic fleets that estimate age-based selectivity and retention and three foreign fleets that mirror the age-based selectivity for the corresponding domestic fleet by gear.  
17. Split the \gls{s-tri} survey into two separate survey fleets in the model and remove select years of age composition data.
18. Revise the fixed and estimated selectivity parameters for the \gls{s-wcgbt} to better fit the age composition data.
19. Switch to a discard fleet approach where discard mortality is estimated outside the model and included as separate fleets. The model now has six fishery fleets: three removal fleets and three discard fleets by gear type.
20. Include empirical weight-at-age.
21. Estimate a single natural mortality for both females and males.
22. Update the assumed steepness from 0.70 to 0.75.
23. Add new recruitment index and estimate annual recruitment deviations as simple deviations.

The 2019 assessment introduced a sea surface height index to inform the estimation of annual recruitment and the model structure of that assessment defined the main period of recruitment to range from 1925 -- 2018.  In Stock Synthesis, a user defines three recruitment periods: early, main, and late. The general guidance for defining recruitment periods is that the main period should be years when annual recruitment deviations are informed by the data (e.g., lower uncertainty intervals). Additionally, the 2019 assessment opted to model annual recruitment deviations with the constraint that the vector of main period deviations sum to zero (e.g. option 1 in Stock Synthesis). During early model explorations it was determined that the decision to start the main period in 1925 combined with the sum to zero constraint had a non-trivial impact on the overall model estimates.  Adjusting the main period for recruitment deviation estimation from 1925 to 1975, when annual recruitment deviations were well informed by the data, increased the estimated summary biomass between 1890 -- 2000 (@fig-structure-bridge-summary-3) and a more depleted population at the end of the time series (@fig-structure-bridge-depl-3). Additionally, during the early period of the time series there was a notable drop in the spawning output by 1960 and then a sharp increase in spawning output peaking in the mid-1970s that was not due to catches, but mostly due to recruitment deviations.  In order to simplify the model, and to estimate data driven trends in the time series early recruitment deviations were not estimated in the selected base model and sensitivities to this decision are also presented in Section \ref{sensitivities}.          

@fig-structure-bridge-summary-4 and @fig-structure-bridge-depl-4 show the impact of removing data from the \gls{s-aslope}, splitting out foreign catches and modeling age-based selectivity and retention, and splitting the \gls{s-tri} and removing select years of age data. There was limited impact on the model estimates from removing the \gls{s-aslope} data and splitting out the foreign catches and moving to age-based retention. Splitting the \gls{s-tri} and removing select years of age composition data reduced the estimate of summary biomass across the time series, but had only a minimal impact to the estimated fraction unfished.  
 
The next steps in the bridging process revised the selectivity for the \gls{s-wcgbt} and changing the model structure to a discard fleet approach (@fig-structure-bridge-summary-5 and @fig-structure-bridge-depl-5).  Revising the estimated and fixed parameters for the \gls{s-wcgbt} decreased the estimate of summary biomass and resulted in a more depleted population compared to the previous model in the structure bridging (e.g., split \gls{s-tri}). The parameterization for this survey in the previous assessment assumed a steep dome-shaped selectivity with a plateau in selectivity around ~ 0.45 for ages 10 and older. In model exploration for this assessment, all parameters from this survey were estimated to provide flexibility for the selectivity shape to change based upon the data and then parameters were fixed at the estimates as necessary (e.g., parameters at bounds, parameters with large uncertainty, etc.).  During this exploration the data supported a steep increase in selectivity between age-0 and age-1, maximum selectivity at age-1, and only a limited dome with a plateau of selectivity for age 3 and older around ~ 0.8. The \gls{s-wcgbt} samples between much of the depth range for sablefish (sampling between 55 -- 1,280 m) and that this survey is thought to be a good sampler of sablefish off the West Coast, this selectivity shape appeared was more in line with apriori expectations for this survey. Removing the estimation of retention and adding discard fleets marginally increased the estimate of summary biomass at the start of the time series and a marginal decrease at the end of the times series compared to the previous bridging model (@fig-structure-bridge-summary-5). 

The final bridging steps included adding time-varying empirical weight-at-age, assuming a single natural mortality value for both sexes, updating the fixed steepness value to `r h`, and adding the recruitment index with a simple deviation approach in Stock Synthesis (@fig-structure-bridge-summary-6 and @fig-structure-bridge-depl-6). Estimates of summary biomass and fraction unfished were relatively similar across models. Switching to an empirical weight-at-age approach slightly increased the estimate of summary biomass across the time series and then revising the assumption around steepness the reduced the estimates of summary biomass at the start of the time series.  The estimated fraction unfished were similar across these models.

In summary, across the model structure bridging, revising the treatment of recruitment deviations (e.g., changing the defined main period) and the selectivity for the \gls{s-wcgbt} has the largest impact on model estimates. Both of these changes were considered improvements to the model structure and essential to align with modeling best practices and to improve fits to the data. A comparison of the base model to the 2023 model, and earlier assessments, is provided in Section \ref{historical}.
