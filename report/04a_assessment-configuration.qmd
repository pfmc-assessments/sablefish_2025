# Assessment

## History of Modeling Approaches

The first `r spp` stock assessment was completed in 1984 [@francis1984sablefish], followed by frequent assessments since then (e.g., @francis1985sablefish, @mcdevitt1987sablefish, @methot1988sablefish, @methot1989sablefish, @methot1990sablefish, @methot1992, @methot1994, @crone1997sablefish, @methot1998sablefish, @schirripa2001sablefish, @schirripa2002sablefish, @schirripa2005sablefish, @schirripa2007sablefish, @stewart2011sablefish, @johnson2016sablefish, @haltuch_status_2019, @kapur_status_2021, @johnson_status_2023). Previous assessments have largely drawn the similar conclusions regarding historical trends. Since the 1970s, the `r spp` resource has show a rapid, persistent decline due to many years with low recruitment and high fishing intensity during 1970s and 1980s. Uncertainty regarding the absolute scale of the `r spp` population has remained high, with previous assessment models suggesting that unfished spawning biomass ranges between just under 100,000 mt up to approximately 250,000 mt.

The 1984 assessment examined catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data from the 1979 to 1983 \gls{nmfs} pot survey [@francis1984sablefish] Subsequent stock assessments were based on age-structured frameworks of varying complexity. The 1985 age-structured assessment utilized a simulation model, estimating $M$, average weight-at-age, recruitment, and relative age-specific catchability, to examine maximum sustainable yield ($MSY$). The model relied on \gls{nmfs} trawl and pot surveys as well as parameter estimates generated from independent research. The 1987 `r spp` assessment extended the NMFS survey time-series and primarily consisted of a modified yield-per-recruitment analysis focusing on the minimum size limit (22 inches) implemented in 1983.

In 1988, a catch-at-age analysis using an early version of the Stock Synthesis modeling framework, which is the basis for all subsequent assessments, was implemented [@methot1988sablefish] This model included two fleets, fixed gear and trawl, and two years of fishery biological data. NMFS trawl and pot surveys provided indices of abundance, and estimates of exploitation rate were based on tag-recapture information generated from a tagging study that began in 1971. The 1989 `r spp` stock assessment followed a similar approach; revisions in the age-determination criteria for `r spp` caused an increase in the observed proportion of old fish and a decrease in the estimate of $M$ from 0.15 to 0.09. The 1990 `r spp` assessment [@methot1990sablefish] explicitly modeled stock structure with a northern population (U.S. Vancouver and Columbia INPFC areas) and a southern population (Eureka, Monterey, and Conception INPFC areas). Including spatial structure was motivated by differences in growth rates and the perception of low migration rates. The spatial models facilitated comparisons between and amongst areas with signals in the raw data.

In 1992, the assessment reverted to a single stock area, excluding the Conception INPFC area [@methot1992] Data from the \gls{s-tri} were used to extrapolate survey estimates to the entire assessment area (Monterey through U.S. Vancouver INPFC areas). Analysis focused on exploring the trade-off in fitting the trawl-survey biomass and the trend from the pot survey. The depth stratified age- and length-composition data suggested that movement of `r spp` into deep water was more closely related to their age than size. The 1994 `r spp` assessment [@methot1994] was similar to the 1992 analysis. The survey was used as an absolute measure of biomass after extrapolation to the coast-wide level. The 1997 assessment [@crone1997sablefish] added CPUE data. No single model was found that fit all indices well. The 1998 assessment [@methot1998sablefish] focused on the inclusion and exclusion of the pot survey index and the use of commercial logbook CPUE.

The 2001 assessment [@schirripa2001sablefish] focused on evaluating the sensitivity of the results to the treatment of the survey data and trade-offs among pot survey and logbook indices of abundance. This assessment was the first to introduce the possibility that `r spp` recruitment may be linked to environmental factors. The 2002 assessment [@schirripa2002sablefish] was an update to [@schirripa2001sablefish] and focused mainly on newly available data from existing sources. It was the first assessment to detect the strong 1999 and 2000 cohorts in the 2001 data, following many years of below average recruitment. A significant relationship between recruitment and sea level was identified.

Several important changes were made to the `r spp` assessment in 2005 [@schirripa2005sablefish]. Landings and the modeled time-period were extended back to the year 1900. Separate selectivity curves were implemented for the trawl surveys, and years with limited geographic coverage in the \gls{s-tri} were eliminated. Discard data from the relatively new observer program were included and discard mortality was investigated. Sea level was used as an explicit offset in the population dynamics to expected recruitment.

The 2007 assessment [@schirripa2007sablefish] included newly available data and changed the treatment of the sea level index of recruitment within the stock assessment model to be a survey index of recruitment with observation error, rather than an explicit offset in the population dynamics to expected recruitment. The assessment made the explicit assumption that catchability for the \gls{s-wcgbt} was equal to 0.56, which was modeled by using only the shelf region. Uncertainty was investigated and reported primarily through alternate values for catchability.

The 2011 stock assessment [@stewart2011sablefish] reduced the number of parameters used to model fishery dynamics. Historical management actions were condensed to those that had a strong influence on fishery behavior (e.g., sorting and retention, selectivity, or both). Previously fixed leading parameters, $M$ and trawl survey catchability, were estimated or used analytical solutions. Changes lead to increased, more realistic, estimates of uncertainty around stock size estimates. Repeated testing of the correlation between sea level and recruitment continued to find a significant relationship that explained approximately 35 percent of the variability in recruitment deviations. The sea-level data was used from 1970 forward, a period with length- and age-composition data, and was not retained in the base model because the index provided a recruitment signal largely consistent with that provided by the composition data. Finally, the large number of deviations about annual growth and annual selectivity curves estimated in the 2007 model were reduced, with the net effect that uncertainty was increased. The sensitivity of model results to ($M$), equilibrium recruitment, and steepness ($h$), which was estimated prior to 2011, was investigated via likelihood profiles. The 2015 stock assessment [@johnson2016sablefish] was an update to the 2011 stock assessment, maintaining the same model structure and focused on adding the new data and retuning the model given the new data.

ADD SUMMARY OF THE 2019 ASSESSMENT AND SUBSEQUENT UPDATES


## Most Recent STAR Panel Recommendations

The [STAR Panel Report](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2019/10/sablefish-star-panel-report-july-8-12-2019.pdf/) from the 2019 benchmark assessment made the following suggestions:

*Short Term*

**Recommendation**: To understand whether regional differences in growth, and associated size or age composition,
are behind the strong tensions observed in age and length composition data, future assessment models should evaluate having separate fixed gear fleets north and south of 36$^\circ$ N (as discussed in unresolved problems and major uncertainties). The potential merits of other regional differences in fleet structure could also be explored. 

**Response**: The STAT explored using regional based fleet, however, there are limited age data available south of 36$^\circ$ N. latitude which prevented further exploration of this approach. The STAT attempted to account for time-varying growth and regional growth by using a empirical weight-at-age approach with the annual weight-at-age applying a biomass weighted approach to estimate a weight-at-age that account for biomass and weight-at-age north and south of 36$^\circ$ N. latitude.


**Recommendation**: Future assessments should consider the use of empirical weights-at-age. One approach would be to begin with the WCGBT data and use it to fit (outside model) a smoother outside the model (see Jim Ianelli for code that uses a random effects model to estimate weights using empirical
data by cohort and year). This would avoids confounding weight at age with growth estimates (e.g., Lee et al. 2019, Whitten et al. 2013), should allow the model to run faster, and should enable the model to better accommodate variability in growth (in both age and over time). Another advantage is that somatic body masses are based on actual measurements instead of model estimates which predicts mean length and then converts length to mass via a fixed set of length-weight parameters

**Response**: The STAT agreed with this recommendation and is now using a empirical weight-at-age approach in this assessment.


**Recommendation**: Consider (and potentially adopt) length based selectivity for the WCGBTS, as selectivity bias could lead to observed age zero fish not being a good representation of mean length at age 0 (which could affect estimates of growth). [Figure 13](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2019/10/sablefish-star-panel-report-july-8-12-2019.pdf/#page = 28) shows some summary results of this issue, including the lack of apparent growth of age 0 sablefish during the period of the survey. A related issue is that specifying the size at age 0.5 (or 1.5), as well as the CV, should be in common by sex. Dimorphic growth presumably occurs at older ages. Future assessments should consider configuring “offsets” for sex differences in the growth. The rationale for this change is that differences between sexes at such young ages seem unlikely and re-configuring the model in this way will reduce the number of parameters needed.

**Response**: This assessment retained age-based selectivity for the \gls{s-wcgbt} in order to incorporate an empirical weight-at-age approach.  The weight-at-age was informed using data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} and should better capture the variation in size-at-age across time.

**Recommendation**: Examine age-specific selectivity that is fixed at a “plus group” age (or have a reasonable
rationale as to why selectivity might be changing over those ages).

**Response**: The selectivities for all fleets in the model estimated a fixed selectivity for older ages.


**Recommendation**: Provide estimates of retention external to the model and evaluate if the approach of doing it
within the model (and then fixing the values because of discard length composition data affecting
model results other than the shape of the retention curve).

**Response**: This assessment moved to a discard fleet approach because there were concerns about model stability with retention being estimated within the model. The discard totals were estimated external to the model and the selectivity for the discard fleets were estimated using estimated discard ages.


**Recommendation**: Reconsider spline or some other non-parametric selectivity forms, as there are unexpected
behaviors observed in estimating double normal selectivities for the fixed gear fishery. The
requirement (apparently) to have to fix the “P6” parameter related to old sablefish selectivity and
some other interactions seems unusual, and several of the convergence issues were related to
selectivity parameters for some gear types/surveys. The 2015 model used a different form for
selectivity and the document provided little justification to choose one over the other. “Fewer
parameters” is a poor reason if performance overall is so much worse. The convergence
problems did seem to be largely resolved after the STAT fixed the CV of young ages.

**Response**:  The STAT explored splines for fishery and survey fleets in the model, but were not found to improve the fits to the data compared to the double-normal selectivity.  


**Recommendation**: The CAAL plots suggest that in the early years of the WCGBTS the residuals of the biggest fish
were generally “young” and in the more recent years the pattern of observed and predicted were more consistent. This could be due to changes in growth and/or size (or age) based selectivity/availability changes and should be investigated. 

**Response**: The STAT agrees that there appeared to be periods where the conditional-age-at-length residuals were generally positive or negative.  The empirical weight-at-age approach explicitly accounts for potential time-varying growth by year.

**Recommendation**: Developing diagnostics that better evaluate sex ratio observations against model predictions
would be useful, especially given some of the differences observed in the fisheries selectivities
estimates and in sex specific natural mortality configurations compared to combined sexes
natural mortality.

**Response**: The `r4ss` package now includes improved sex ratio figures. Additionally, the sex ratio of observed ages for all fishing and survey fleets were evaluated to determine whether sex-specific selectivity was occurring. The hook-and-line and pot gear have greater selectivity for females compared to males which could lead to changes in sex ratios of selected fish over time.  The STAT did not find clear evidence for differing natural mortality rates by sex and a single natural mortality for both sexes.  


**Recommendation**: Reducing the number of ages should be considered, as the plus group information and dynamics
beyond some ages are unlikely to change (as shown in [Figure 14]((https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2019/10/sablefish-star-panel-report-july-8-12-2019.pdf/#page = 29))).

**Response**: The STAT agrees that the data plus group of age-50 may be larger than necessary and future assessments should continue to evaluate this, but given the other extensive model structure changes in this assessment a data plus group of age-50 was retained.


**Recommendation**: Continuing to evaluate the use of sea level and/or other environmental indicators as drivers of
both historic and future recruitments is strongly encouraged, and future assessments should strive
to clearly convey how such data explicitly relate to recruitment as well as to convey the logic and
presumed mechanisms behind the relationship.

**Response**:  The assessment opted to use a recruitment index that covered the last five years of the model given that there are significant survey and fishery data to inform recruitment estimation for earlier years.  Additionally, preliminary research conducted by Dr. Kiva Oken (Northwest Fisheries Science Center) determined that including longer time series of recruitment indices may bias estimates of stock size and recommended that these indices be isolated to periods where there are little to no information about recruitment from other data sources in the model.


*Medium and Long Term*

**Recommendation**: The panel had concerns about the large amount of data and the challenges faced doing things
such as estimating natural mortality and the CVs on growth and other factors. However, the core
growth parameters were generally stable, and convergence problems are not atypical when
natural mortality is difficult to estimate and selectivity patterns are all dome-shaped. The panel
notes that it is worth reflecting on whether a somewhat different modeling approach would work
better (in the longer term). The nature of the issues in the data may be stretching the capacity of
the analytical framework and software to do what needs to be done.

**Response**: The STAT agrees that estimating growth, natural mortality, selectivity, and retention with this assessment could lead to an unstable model (e.g., variable estimates across sensitivities, and/or inability to invert the hessian).  To address these issues this assessment made significant efforts to simplify the model structure and to improve paramaterization of key processes.


**Recommendation**: The STAT provided very helpful updates on ongoing efforts to evaluate life history
characteristics, movement patterns and management approaches throughout the range of
sablefish in the Northeast Pacific. The STAR Panel agrees with the STAT that ongoing and
future work, such as efforts to develop a transboundary stock assessment and management
framework, be pursued. This is based on strong indications that current stock boundaries are
likely to be inappropriate, and that a transboundary assessment would likely improve the ability
to estimate the scale of the population.

**Response**: This STAT agrees that work should continue to evaluate coherence of sablefish across the Northeast Pacific, emigration, and migration rates across assessment boundaries.

**Recommendation**: As the WCGBTS is highly informative in the model, maintaining full coastwide survey effort is
essential. However, currently the survey does not include a large fraction of the habitat south of
36$^\circ$ N, the cowcod conservation areas. Despite a lack of data in this large area, catch is allocated north and south of 36$^\circ$ N based on the estimated fraction of sablefish in these areas, and this fraction, in turn, is based on an extrapolation of survey catch rates outside the CCAs to those
inside. As fish within the CCAs are only subject to fishing pressure if and when they move, and
movement rates are variable, this concentration of effort outside of the CCAs could potentially
lead to localized depletion, which in turn could bias the signal in fishery (and potentially survey)
age and length composition from the fished areas. It would be beneficial to have survey data
from within the CCAs to inform the survey, and to allow for some evaluation of whether and
how population structure may vary inside and outside of the CCAs. There could be some
potential for local depletion elsewhere as well, given the concentration of trawl effort off of
Oregon and Washington and the decline in fishing effort and catches of both trawl and fished
gear in California north of 36$^\circ$ N.

**Response**:  The STAT attempted to evaluate the proportion of trawlable habitat south of 34$^\circ$ 47$^\prime$ N. latitude but did not have time to complete this analysis. The STAT notes that a spatio-temporal model is currently used to estimated the index of abundance for the \gls{s-wcgbt} which can incorporate spatial and temporal information to smooth estiamtes across sampled and unsampled areas. However, composition data are limited by areas sampled and if there are differences in sablefish abundance, size or age structured in unsampled areas these will not be accounted for in the biological data.   

**Recommendation**: For the WCGBTS, evaluate cohort total mortality ($Z$) for consistency and as a check with model
values. Comparing the survey estimate numbers at age over time (e.g., relative abundance at age
2 in year $y$ compared to abundance at age 3 in year $y+1$). 

**Response**: The STAT did not have sufficient time to address this recommendation and agrees that future STAT should work to understand cohort mortality.

**Recommendation**: Better estimates of aging error, bias and continued efforts to improve on age validation remain
high research priorities. 

**Response**: This assessment incorporated an updated ageing error estimate of uncertainty and bias using Template Model Builder which can account for random effects.  The STAT agrees that future work should be done to improve age validation which can improve our understanding of the population and age-structure for sablefish off the U.S. West Coast.


## Model Structure and Assumptions

### Modeling Platform and Structure

The assessment was conducted used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.24 developed by Dr. Richard Methot at the NOAA, NWFSC [@MethotWetzel2013]. This most recent version was used because it included improvements and corrections to older model versions. Previous assessments of sablefish also used Stock Synthesis but an earlier version, 3.30.21; model bridging was performed between both versions of Stock Synthesis and discussed below. The `R` package `r4ss`, version 1.51.0, along with `R` version 4.4.1 were used to investigate and plot model fits.

### Model Selection and Evaluation

The base assessment model for Dover sole was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning biomass trajectory for the population of Dover sole off the west coast of the U.S. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model.

### Priors

Priors were used to determine fixed parameter values for natural mortality ($M$) and steepness ($h$) in the base model. The prior distribution for natural mortality was based on the @hamel_development_2022 meta-analytic approach with an assumed maximum age of 75 years for both males and females. The prior assumed a log normal distribution for natural mortality. The log normal prior has a median of 0.072 yr$^{-1}$ and a standard error of 0.31. 

The treatment of $h$ has varied across recent assessment. The assessment conducted in 2007 estimated $h$ = 0.43, the 2011 assessment fixed $h$ = 0.60 based upon @he_prior_2006, and the 2019 assessment fixed $h$ = 0.70.  The prior for steepness assumed a beta distribution with mean of 0.70 and standard error of 0.223.
