Most of the research needs listed below entail investigations that need to take place outside of the routine assessment cycle and require additional resources to be completed.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Spatiotemporal distribution patterns with depth: There are patterns of age and sex
ratios with depth which may indicate that the stock is more complex than currently
modeled. Further research into the causes of these patterns as well as differences
between seasons would help with understanding the stock characteristics such that
a more realistic model could be built. This may also provide further insight into
migration and help determine if there are localized populations.

\item Stock boundaries: A common question in stock assessments is whether or not the
entire stock is being represented. Sablefish live deeper than the range of the fisheries
and surveys. The assessment model attempts to account for out of area biomass
through catchability coefficients and selectivity curves, but that portion of the stock is
unknown and can only be conjectured. Research into abundance in deep areas would
be useful to verify that the assessment adequately predicts the entire spawning stock
of sablefish.

\item Recruitment: Investigation of environmental covariates for recruitment on a stock-wide, northeast Pacific scale.

\item Stock trends: The \gls{s-wcgbt} was a critical data source in this assessment providing data about the age distribution of the stock, incoming recruitment with observations of age-0 fish, and an informative trend in biomass. Continuation of the annual \gls{s-wcgbt} will provide information on stock trends and incoming recruitments. A longer survey time series may improve the precision of estimates of absolute stock size and productivity into the future.

\item Ageing: Age validation is needed to verify the level of age bias present in the data, if any.

\item Temporal and spatial biology: Research on understanding the interactions between spatial patterns in sablefish growth and maturity across space and time will provide important information for future assessments.
