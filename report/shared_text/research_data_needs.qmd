Most of the research needs listed below entail investigations that need to take place outside of the routine assessment cycle and require additional resources to be completed.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Spatiotemporal distribution patterns with depth: There are patterns of age and sex
ratios with depth which may indicate that the stock is more complex than currently
modeled. Further research into the causes of these patterns as well as differences
between seasons would help with understanding the stock characteristics such that
a more realistic model could be built if needed. This may also provide further insight into
migration and help determine if there are localized populations.

\item Stock boundaries: A common question in stock assessments is whether or not the
entire stock is being represented. Sablefish live deeper than the range of the fisheries
and surveys off the U.S. West Coast. The assessment model attempts to account for out of area biomass
through catchability coefficients and selectivity curves, but that portion of the stock is
unknown and can only be conjectured. Research into abundance in deep areas would
be useful to verify that the assessment adequately predicts the entire stock
of sablefish. In addition, sablefish along the U.S. West Coast can move northward to
Canada or Alaska management jurisdictions. Building on recent transboundary sablefish research
(Kapur et al. 2024, Kapur et al. in press), investigations elucidating how variable movements (net
emigration and immigration) are from year to year to better understand impacts on current
management advice or, ultimately, incorporate these changes into stock assessment models.

\item Recruitment: Continued investigation and refinement of environmental covariates for
recruitment on a stock-wide, northeast Pacific scale. Continued evaluations into the estimation
of steepness ($h$) is warranted in future stock assessments 

\item Stock trends: The WCGBTS is a critical data source in this assessment providing data
about the age distribution of the stock, incoming recruitment with observations of age-0 fish, and
an informative trend in biomass. Continuation of the annual WCGBTS will provide information
on stock trends and incoming recruitments. A longer survey time series may improve the precision of
estimates of absolute stock size and productivity into the future. This is particularly true now that
the stock has had substantial contrast (declines and inclines) in stock biomass, catch, and
recruitment dynamics. 

\item Ageing: Age validation is needed to verify the level of age bias present in the data, if any.
The assessment model now uses empirical weight-at-age data to track spatiotemporal variation in growth.
The continuation of collecting representative otolith samples and fish weights from fishery-independent and fishery-dependent
sources, and processing those samples for age determination, is required to continue including time-varying
growth into the assessment model. Continued research and pilot applications using Fourier Transform
Near-Infared Spectroscopy (FT-NIRS) methods for ageing, which includes an understanding of the potential
benefits (e.g., increase age determination throughput and efficiency) and barriers (e.g., bias)
specific to sablefish could help to achieve ongoing ageing goals given competing demands for available
resources. In addition, there is an under-representation of ages from sablefish caught in fisheries off of California
compared to other areas. Biological sampling designs should strive to be consistent across the stock domain.

\item Fish Weight: This assessment uses an empirical weight-at-age approach to account for spatially and time varying growth informed by data from the WCGBTS. Currently, fish weight information is not available coastwide commercial fisheries (e.g., information available in PacFIN).  Collected and reporting fish weight information to port sampling coastwide would support the consideration of commercial fishery data to understand weight-at-age of sablefish for future assessments. 

\item Temporal and spatial biology: Research on understanding the interactions between spatial patterns in
sablefish growth, maturity, and natural mortality across space and time will provide important information for future assessments.
Both growth and maturity show latitudinal trends across the stock domain. While the current assessment
accounts for these trends in the pre-processing of the data provided to the assessment model, it does so in a limited way.
While tracking spatiotemporal changes in natural mortality by sex or life-stage is difficult, often requiring data
that is unavailable (e.g., extensive tagging data), there has been recent advances through the use of external
ecosystem modeling approaches such as the Climate- Enhanced, Age-based model with Temperature-specific Trophic
Linkages and Energetics (CEATTLE) that should be explored for sablefish.
