The base model was developed with the goal of balancing parsimony with realism and fitting the data well. To achieve parsimony, some simplification of model structure was assumed which may have a moderate impact on the interpretation and fit to specific data sets. The base model was developed with a focus on stability which supports model development, interpretability, and future update assessments. This assessment estimates a sharp increase in young sablefish biomass and future data collected by the WCGBTS should be monitored potential changes in the population trajectories.  

The estimated increase in young sablefish biomass is being driven by  very large recruitment events occurring in recent years (e.g., 2020, 2021, and 2023). There have been multiple observations of the 2020 and 2021 year class and appear to be well estimated by the model. However, there is more uncertainty around the 2023 year class given the limited observations in the data by the the WCGBTS and the fishery fleets. The uncertainty around the strength of this year class will be resolved with future observations by the survey and the fishery. 

The patterns observed in historical `r spp` recruitment suggest that the stock trajectory, which is dominated by  shifts in recruitment strength, is closely linked to productivity regimes in the California Current. Studies of oceanographic drivers of `r spp` recruitment explain some portion of recruitment variability for sablefish, depending upon the oceanographic covariates evaluated. Uncertainty in future environmental conditions and changes in the timing, dynamics, and productivity of the California Current ecosystem via climate change or cycles similar to the historical period should be considered as a significant source of uncertainty in all projections of stock status. The ongoing WCGBTS is a fairly precise relative index of abundance over a broad demographic component of the stock but it does not survey the entire stock as `r spp` reside in waters deeper than 1,280 m and to the north and south of the survey extent. Therefore, a portion of the stock is unobserved. This index has the potential to inform future stock assessments about the scale of the population relative to catches being removed; however, such information will require contrast in the observed survey trend.

Sablefish appear to have variable maturity-at-age latitudinally across the U.S. West Coast. Additionally, there appears to be variable growth spatially and temporally.  This assessment attempts to account for these variations by using a empirical weight-at-age approach that accounts for space and time. In the available data, there were not clear trends across time but rather periods of above or below average growth. Future data should continue to be evaluated for potential trends in growth and maturity and whether those observed patterns vary from what was assumed in this assessment.
