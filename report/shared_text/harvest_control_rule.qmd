The \gls{pfmc} groundfish \gls{fmp} includes \gls{hcr} based upon general species groups that determines the \gls{ofl} and \gls{abc}. The target, threshold, and limit reference points for `r spp` as defined by the \gls{fmp} as 40, 25, and 10 percent stock status, respectively. The \gls{ofl} is determined by the target harvest rate based an \gls{spr} rate of 45 percent ($\text{SPR}_{45\%}$).  If the stock is above the management target of 40 percent, the \gls{abc} is equal to a fraction of the \gls{ofl} based on time-varying scientific uncertainty ($\sigma_y$) and management risk tolerance (P$^*$). When the stock status is below the management target and above the management limit, the \gls{abc} is linearly reduced using the \gls{hcr} to determine the \gls{acl}. If the stock is below the management limit, 10 percent, the \gls{acl} is set to zero.  Additionally, if the stock is estimated to be below the management threshold, 25 percent, in the year of the assessment, a rebuilding plan is required which can set the $\text{SPR}$ to a fishing intensity lower than the target $\text{SPR}_{45\%}$.
