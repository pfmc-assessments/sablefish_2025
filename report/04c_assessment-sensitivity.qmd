### Convergence

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum.
Starting parameters were jittered using the jitter function built into Stock Synthesis, using jitter input of 0.05. This was repeated 100 times with non eof the 100 runs returning to the
base model likelihood. However, a better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. In the jittering analysis models with similar log-likelihood values (difference < 0.50 units) were often found with little difference in overall model estimates indicating a relatively flat likelihood surface around the maximum likelihood estimate. Additionally, jitters using a smaller jitter value yielded an increased frequency of runs returning to the base model with no models finding a better fit to the data. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate a Hessian.
